Glucose 6-phosphate (g6p) This phosphorylation step utilises ATP as a phosphate donor this first phosphorylation event can only happen on C6 as C1 is a carbonyl group which cannot be phosphorylated

Method of administration. Self-administered by SC injection in abdomen, buttocks, arm, and leg. Given intravenously for emergency ketoacidosis. b. Regimens Most type I diabetic patients require 0.5 to 1.0 unit/kg per day to achieve acceptable glycemic control. Start with a conservative dose (0.2 units/kg) and adjust the regimen according to the patient\u2019s glucose levels. Many different regimens exist, and every patient has unique needs (see Table 4-5). c. Intensive insulin therapy Long-acting insulin is given once daily in the evening. Regular insulin is given 30 to 45 minutes before each meal, and should be adjusted according to preprandial home glucose measurements. These more aggressive therapies have been shown to significantly decrease the incidence of diabetes complications such as retinopathy and microalbuminuria when compared to prior regimens. All attempts should be made to get patients on more aggressive treatment protocols. With intensive insulin therapy, the risk for hypoglycemia is a serious concern. Alternatively, a continuous SC infusion of insulin can be given via an insulin pump. Preprandial boluses are given in addition to the basal infusion. d. If the patient is unable/unwilling to carry out an intensive insulin program: Give 70/30 units before breakfast and before the evening meal for basal coverage. Give a short-acting insulin (regular) for prandial control if necessary. Adjust doses according to fasting and 4 PM glucose determinations. e. Inpatient management of diabetic patients (sliding scale). An insulin sliding scale (SSI) of regular insulin doses given according to bedside finger-stick glucose determinations is helpful in controlling blood glucose levels in the hospital setting. SSI should be used in addition to a regimen of long-acting insulin. If given alone, hyperglycemia usually results. Monitor blood glucose four times per day: before meals and at bedtime. Once insulin therapy is started, a blood glucose goal of 140 to 180 mg/dL should be targeted for most patients. If the home insulin dose is unclear, or if the patient anticipates greater requirements of insulin due to an illness, use the following approach to adjust appropriate insulin doses: Take the total number of units of regular insulin that the patient required in 1 day (while on the sliding scale). Add two-thirds of this to the prebreakfast dose and one-third before dinner. It should be given as 70/30 (i.e., 70% NPH/30% regular). In practice, remember that often patients will be placed on a basal-bolus dosing with long- and short-acting insulin with meals. f. Modifying insulin doses (see also Clinical Pearl 4-3) Physical activity\u2014depending on the intensity of the activity, decrease insulin dosage 1 to 2 units per 20 to 30 minutes of activity. During illness, administer all of the routine insulin. Many episodes of DKA occur during episodes of illness. Stress and changes in diet require dosing adjustments.

This should be considered in symptomatic patients, or in those with significant LV dysfunction on echocardiogram. Acute AR (e.g., post-MI): Medical emergency\u2014emergent aortic valve replacement! Prognosis Case: A 64-year-old man presents to the clinic with a 3-month history of worsening shortness of breath. He finds that he becomes short of breath after walking one block or one flight of stairs. He awakens at night, gasping for breath, and has to prop himself up with pillows in order to sleep. On physical examination, his blood pressure is 190/60 mm Hg and his pulses are hyperdynamic. His apical impulse is displaced to the left and downward. On physical examination, there are rales over both lower lung fields. On cardiac examination, there are three distinct murmurs: a high-pitched, early diastolic murmur loudest at the left lower sternal border, a diastolic rumble heard at the apex, and a crescendo\u2013decrescendo systolic murmur heard at the left upper sternal border. Chest x-ray film shows cardiomegaly and pulmonary edema, and an echocardiogram shows severe aortic regurgitation with a dilated and hypertrophied left ventricle. Questions What accounts for the dilation and hypertrophy of the left ventricle in aortic regurgitation? In aortic regurgitation, the increased blood returning to the LV from the aorta results in a volume overload of the heart. This will result in the eccentric hypertrophy of the left ventricle due to stretching, and as a result, the ventricle will dilate. The fundamental problem in aortic regurgitation is volume overload of the left ventricle during diastole. In aortic regurgitation, blood enters the left ventricle from both the pulmonary veins and the aorta (through the leaky aortic valve). The left ventricular stroke volume can increase dramatically, although the effective stroke volume may be minimally changed since much of the increase in stroke volume leaks back into the left ventricle. If the regurgitation develops slowly, the heart responds to the increased diastolic volume with sarcomere elongation (dilation) and wall thickening (hypertrophy). This can result in an enlarged heart that is displaced to the left. All these changes are characteristic of slowly progressive aortic regurgitation. However, if the condition develops quickly, over a few days, such as during aortic valve destruction as a result of infective endocarditis, these compensatory mechanisms do not have a chance to develop. What is the pathophysiology of the wide pulse pressure (difference between the systolic and diastolic blood pressure) and the hyperdynamic pulses? Corrigan's sign (wide pulse pressure / waterhammer pulse) comes as a result of the backflow of blood via the aorta into the heart - this will reduce the diastolic blood pressure. In order to maintain a normal mean arterial pressure (And as a result of Frank-starling forces), the increased left ventricular stretch will generate a greater systolic pressure - this wide pulse pressure is responsible for Corrigan's sign. In aortic regurgitation, the pulse pressure is widened both because of an increase in systolic pressure and a falling diastolic pressure. The systolic pressure increases owing to the increased stroke volume. The diastolic pressure decreases owing to the regurgitant flow back into the left ventricle and the increased compliance of the great vessels. This large difference between systolic and diastolic pressures is readily felt in the peripheral pulse as a sudden rise, then drop, in pressure. There are many physical signs resulting from this phenomenon, including the so-called water-hammer pulse (Corrigan pulse), head bobbing (de Musset sign), uvula pulsation (M\u00fcller sign), and arterial nailbed pulsations (Quincke pulse). What explains the murmurs heard in this patient? The early diastolic murmurs are due to regurgitation of blood via the aorta, resulting in vibrations of the aortic valves. The high-pitched diastolic murmur at the left lower sternal border is from the regurgitant flow through the leaky aortic valve. The diastolic rumbling at the apex, also known as the Austin Flint murmur, is from the regurgitant flow impinging on the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve, causing a functional mitral stenosis. The systolic murmur at the left upper sternal border is from the increased stroke volume flowing across the aortic valve during systole. What are the underlying mechanisms responsible for the patient\u2019s shortness of breath with exertion and at night? Early in aortic regurgitation, there is no heart failure because the left ventricle adapts to the increased volume by enlarging and thickening. However, at some point the compensatory mechanisms fail, and the end-diastolic pressure in the left ventricle rises. This rise in end-diastolic pressure is transmitted through the pulmonary veins to the lungs, where it results in pulmonary edema owing to increases in hydrostatic pressure. This buildup of fluid in the alveoli causes impaired oxygenation, leading to shortness of breath. In milder cases, the shortness of breath may become evident only when there is increased demand; in severe cases, it may manifest at rest. For example, increased demand can occur during exertion. It may also occur during sleep, when the supine position allows the interstitial fluid from dependent tissues to re-enter the circulation, causing an increased intravascular volume.","title":"Aortic Regurgitation"},{"location":"IM/Cardiology/Aortic%20Regurgitation.html#aortic-regurgitation","text":"","title":"Aortic Regurgitation"},{"location":"IM/Cardiology/Aortic%20Regurgitation.html#background","text":"Acute Infective endocarditis Trauma Aortic dissection Iatrogenic as during a failed replacement surgery Chronic Valvular causes Congenital Bicuspid Aortic Valve (BAV) Infective endocarditis , Rheumatic heart disease (will not typically occur without MR and AS) Myxomatous ( Atrial Myxoma \u2192 Mitral valve prolapse (Barlow syndrome) ) Connective tissue - Marfains, Ehler-Danlos syndrome, SLE Traumatic Syphilis Scarring and retraction of the aortic valve leaflets Ankylosing Spondylitis Scarring and retracting of the aortic valve leaflets Root disease (aortic annular dilatation) Aortic dissection, cystic medial degeneration, Osteogenesis imperfecta, hypertension BAV Aortitis Luetic Heart / Syphilis Cellular infiltration and scarring of the media of the thoracic aorta \u2192 aortic dilation, aneurysm formation and severe regurgitation intima involvement \u2192 coronary ostia narrowing \u2192 myocardial ischaemia Takayasu arteritis / Giant cell (temporal) arteritis Aneurysm formation \u2192 secondary AR Behcet's syndrome, Reiter syndrome","title":"Background"},{"location":"IM/Cardiology/Aortic%20Regurgitation.html#pathology","text":"Pathophysiology Also called aortic insufficiency; this condition is due to inadequate closure of the aortic valve leaflets.

Prognosis Case A 59-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by ambulance after experiencing a syncopal episode. He states that he was running in the park when he suddenly lost consciousness. He denies any symptoms preceding the event, and he had no deficits or symptoms upon arousing. On review of systems, he does say that he has had substernal chest pressure associated with exercise for the past several weeks. Each episode was relieved with rest. He denies shortness of breath, dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea, and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. His medical history is notable for multiple episodes of pharyngitis as a child. He is otherwise well. He has no significant family history. He was born in Mexico and moved to the United States at age 10 years. He does not smoke, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. On examination, his blood pressure is 110/90 mm Hg, heart rate 95 bpm, respiratory rate 15/min, and oxygen saturation 98%. Neck examination reveals both pulsus parvus and pulsus tardus. Cardiac examination reveals a laterally displaced and sustained apical impulse. He has a grade 3/6 midsystolic murmur, loudest at the base of the heart, radiating to the neck, and a grade 1/6 high-pitched, blowing, early diastolic murmur along the left sternal border. An S4 is audible. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Abdominal examination is benign. He has no lower extremity edema. Aortic stenosis is suspected.

Patients born with a bicuspid aortic valve have structural abnormalities of the ascending aorta predisposing them to aneurysm and dissection. It is estimated that bicuspid valve disease accounts for more morbidity and mortality than all other congenital cardiac lesions combined. Pathology Evidence now points to a congenital pattern of inheritance, and the fundamental embryology is being elucidated in animal models. The specific genetic mutations in humans with bicuspid valve have proven complex and multifactorial; abnormalities in the NOTCH1 gene have been documented, but only in some bicuspid patients. Evidence shows that excess MMP activity characterizes both the valve tissue and the aortic wall in bicuspid patients. The aorta grows more rapidly in bicuspid patients. The normal, tricuspid aortic valve has three equal cusps and three commissures where the edges of the cusps connect to the aortic wall. The congenital bicuspid aortic valve has two commissures with two, unequal sized cusps and a raphe (a seam-like ridge found at the base of the conjoined cusp indicating the site of the abortive commissure) The right and left cusps are most frequently fused (75\u201385%) with right and left commissures, creating a conjoined larger, anterior cusp with a raph\u00e9, and a posterior cusp. Of note, the coronary arteries arise from their usual, anterior locations. The three cusps of a normal, tricuspid aortic valve completely retract to the aortic wall when open and meet in the middle of the opening when closed. The unequal size of the cusps and the fibrous ridge at the base of the conjoined cusp in a bicuspid aortic valve prevent the larger cusp from completely retracting to the aorta and from meeting the smaller cusp to close. The congenital bicuspid valve is not initially stenotic; however, the valve abnormality causes turbulent blood flow at valve that leads to degenerative changes and calcium deposits similar to those seen with senile aortic valve stenosis. The degenerative changes and calcification occurs earlier than with a tricuspid valve. The gross pathology shows calcification of a valve with only two commissures and cusps. Clinical features Initially, the valve causes no symptoms. On physical examination, an ejection sound or a click with a brief ejection murmur may be heard. As the stenosis worsens, the patient may exhibit the same symptoms as described earlier. Patients with a bicuspid aortic valve will present much earlier (45\u201355 years of age) than those with senile calcific aortic stenosis (70\u201380 years of age). Diagnostic criteria Investigations Management Especially when there is associated valvular dysfunction, the current trend favors aggressive aortic resection in bicuspid patients with ascending aortic aneurysms (although specific criteria have varied in different editions of standard guidelines). The congenitally bicuspid aortic valve may be an isolated finding or may be associated with other lesions of CHD. Bicuspid aortic valve may be transmitted in an autosomal dominant pattern, may occur sporadically, or can be associated with coarctation of the aorta or Turner syndrome. Patients with a bicuspid aortic valve are routinely monitored for signs and symptoms of progressive valve dysfunction with echocardiography. Surgical placement of a mechanical prosthetic valve leads to a life of anticoagulation therapy. Implantation of a bioprosthesis may lead to additional surgeries, as the typical lifespan of a bioprosthetic valve is approximately 15 years (and may be shorter in young adults), and the patients present 10\u201320 years earlier than those with senile calcific aortic stenosis. Patients with a congenitally bicuspid aortic valve are also known to have an increased risk for acute aortic dissection due to an inherent medial weakness. These patients require surveillance for aortic valve dysfunction and changes of the ascending thoracic aorta. In a study of the International Registry of Acute Aortic Dissection (IRAD), 9% of patients less than 40 years old with an acute aortic dissection had a bicuspid aortic valve compared with 1% of those greater than 40 years old. Prognosis Patients with congenital bicuspid aortic valve have structural abnormalities of the ascending aorta predisposing to aneurysm and dissection. Many authorities believe that this disease is so virulent that every individual with a bicuspid aortic valve will, given enough time, develop aortic stenosis, aortic insufficiency, or aortic aneurysm or dissection related to the bicuspid valve disease. Some have aortic coarctation as part of this syndrome as well. Aneurysmal enlargement of the aorta in patients with bicuspid aortic valve may occur independent of valvular stenosis or regurgitation and is not, therefore, predominantly a consequence of poststenotic dilation, although the aorta expands more rapidly when valvular dysfunction is present. Because bicuspid valves occur in ~2% of the population, the associated aortopathy is responsible for more cases of aortic dissection than the Marfan syndrome (which affects one in 10,000 people) Ascending aortic aneurysm in patients with bicuspid aortic valve is currently considered nearly as serious as ascending aortic aneurysm in patients with Marfan disease, and operation is often offered earlier than in nonbicuspid patients. The histology and mechanical properties of the ascending aorta in patients with bicuspid aortic valves may predispose to dissection at smaller diameters than in patients with structurally normal (tricuspid) aortic valves.","title":"Bicuspid Aortic Valve"},{"location":"IM/Cardiology/Bicuspid%20Aortic%20Valve.html#bicuspid-aortic-valve","text":"","title":"Bicuspid Aortic Valve"},{"location":"IM/Cardiology/Bicuspid%20Aortic%20Valve.html#background","text":"Approximately 1\u20132% of the population is born with a congenitally abnormal aortic valve, making it one of the most common types of CHD. Patients born with a bicuspid aortic valve have structural abnormalities of the ascending aorta predisposing them to aneurysm and dissection. It is estimated that bicuspid valve disease accounts for more morbidity and mortality than all other congenital cardiac lesions combined.","title":"Background"},{"location":"IM/Cardiology/Bicuspid%20Aortic%20Valve.html#pathology","text":"Evidence now points to a congenital pattern of inheritance, and the fundamental embryology is being elucidated in animal models. The specific genetic mutations in humans with bicuspid valve have proven complex and multifactorial; abnormalities in the NOTCH1 gene have been documented, but only in some bicuspid patients. Evidence shows that excess MMP activity characterizes both the valve tissue and the aortic wall in bicuspid patients. The aorta grows more rapidly in bicuspid patients. The normal, tricuspid aortic valve has three equal cusps and three commissures where the edges of the cusps connect to the aortic wall. The congenital bicuspid aortic valve has two commissures with two, unequal sized cusps and a raphe (a seam-like ridge found at the base of the conjoined cusp indicating the site of the abortive commissure) The right and left cusps are most frequently fused (75\u201385%) with right and left commissures, creating a conjoined larger, anterior cusp with a raph\u00e9, and a posterior cusp. Of note, the coronary arteries arise from their usual, anterior locations. The three cusps of a normal, tricuspid aortic valve completely retract to the aortic wall when open and meet in the middle of the opening when closed. The unequal size of the cusps and the fibrous ridge at the base of the conjoined cusp in a bicuspid aortic valve prevent the larger cusp from completely retracting to the aorta and from meeting the smaller cusp to close. The congenital bicuspid valve is not initially stenotic; however, the valve abnormality causes turbulent blood flow at valve that leads to degenerative changes and calcium deposits similar to those seen with senile aortic valve stenosis. The degenerative changes and calcification occurs earlier than with a tricuspid valve. The gross pathology shows calcification of a valve with only two commissures and cusps.","title":"Pathology"},{"location":"IM/Cardiology/Bicuspid%20Aortic%20Valve.html#clinical-features","text":"Initially, the valve causes no symptoms. On physical examination, an ejection sound or a click with a brief ejection murmur may be heard. As the stenosis worsens, the patient may exhibit the same symptoms as described earlier.

The congenitally bicuspid aortic valve may be an isolated finding or may be associated with other lesions of CHD. Bicuspid aortic valve may be transmitted in an autosomal dominant pattern, may occur sporadically, or can be associated with coarctation of the aorta or Turner syndrome. Patients with a bicuspid aortic valve are routinely monitored for signs and symptoms of progressive valve dysfunction with echocardiography. Surgical placement of a mechanical prosthetic valve leads to a life of anticoagulation therapy. Implantation of a bioprosthesis may lead to additional surgeries, as the typical lifespan of a bioprosthetic valve is approximately 15 years (and may be shorter in young adults), and the patients present 10\u201320 years earlier than those with senile calcific aortic stenosis. Patients with a congenitally bicuspid aortic valve are also known to have an increased risk for acute aortic dissection due to an inherent medial weakness. These patients require surveillance for aortic valve dysfunction and changes of the ascending thoracic aorta.

rigidity and thickening of the pericardium, with obliteration of the pericardial cavity. Pathophysiology A fibrotic, rigid pericardium restricts the diastolic filling of the heart. Ventricular filling is unimpeded during early diastole because intracardiac volume has not yet reached the limit defined by the stiff pericardium. When intracardiac volume reaches the limit set by the noncompliant pericardium, ventricular filling is halted abruptly. (In contrast, ventricular filling is impeded throughout diastole in cardiac tamponade.) Causes In most patients, the cause is never identified and is idiopathic or related to a previous viral infection. Other causes include recurrent pericarditis uremia radiation therapy tuberculosis (Tuberculous pericarditis) \u2192 most common cause in asia and africa (where it is a common feature of AIDS) Haemopericardium Viral pericarditis Rheumatoid arthritis, SLE chronic pericardial effusion tumor invasion (Neoplastic) connective tissue disorders Polyserositis prior surgery involving the pericardium (post-pericardotomy syndrome) purulent pericarditis (secondary to infection by S. aureus) Clinical Features Patients appear very ill Patients with constrictive pericarditis typically present in one of the two ways: With symptoms characteristic of fluid overload such as edema, ascites, and pleural effusions With symptoms related to the diminished cardiac output such as dyspnea on exertion, fatigue, decreased exercise tolerance, and cachexia Patient can present with a combination of both of these findings Signs include: JVD\u2014most prominent physical finding; central venous pressure (CVP) is elevated and displays prominent x and y descents Due to the abrupt cessation of diastolic filling within the constrictive pericardium (restricted ventricular filling) Kussmaul sign\u2014JVP (venous pressure) paradoxically increases during inspiration Inspiration \u2192 increases filling \u2192 restricted pericardium (limited ventricular diastolic volume) \u2192 fluid bounces upwards via RA Pericardial knock\u2014corresponding to the abrupt cessation of ventricular filling Ascites Dependent edema May be difficult to distinguish from restrictive cardiomyopathy\u2014may require echo or cardiac catheterization to distinguish these entities \ud83d\udca1 **Quick HIT** If a patient has clinical signs of cirrhosis (ascites, hepatomegaly) and distended neck veins, perform tests to rule out constrictive pericarditis. \ud83d\udca1 **Quick HIT** Often, constrictive pericarditis progresses to worsening cardiac output and to hepatic and/or renal failure.

When preload is low (at rest), there is little difference in performance between a normal and a failing heart. However, with exertion a failing heart produces relatively less contractility and symptoms occur Left heart failure: Alveolar oedema presents with pink transulate alveolar macrophages present, filled with haemosiderin, called heart failure cells (HF cells): rupture of pulmonary capillaries \u2192 RBCs enter alveoli and phagocytosed by alveolar MPs \u2192 excess iron in macrophages \u2192 iron binds to ferritin \u2192 degrades into haemosiderin \u2192 produces a rust-coloured sputum Right heart failure: hepatomegaly due to hepatic congestion centrilobular haemorrhagic necrosis - due to reduced oxygen tension and a lack of blood flow to the centrilobular region Classification HFrEF (systolic) vs HFpEF (diastolic) determines prognosis and pathology Heart Failure with reduced Ejection Fraction (HFrEF) or systolic dysfunction Owing to impaired contractility (reduced EF <40%) or increased afterload reduced EF \u2192 increased preload \u2192 F-S law \u2192 increased myocardial contractility \u2192 myocardial hypertrophy and ventricular dilation Myocardial infarct \u2192 cellular death \u2192 reduced contractile cells in the heart \u2192 eccentric hypertrophy of the heart \u2192 HFrEF Causes include: Ischemic heart disease or after a recent MI\u2014infarcted cardiac muscle does not pump blood (decreased EF) Myocarditis (postviral, giant cell, autoimmune) Valvular heart disease (usually MR, aortic regurgitation) Dilated cardiomyopathy: Drugs: Alcohol, cocaine, methamphetamines, chemotherapy (anthracyclines and trastuzumab) Infiltrative disease (amyloidosis, sarcoidosis, hemochromatosis, Wilson disease) Radiation therapy Thyroid disease Peripartum cardiomyopathy Infectious disease (Chagas disease, HIV, endocarditis causing valvular disease) Congenital/hereditary High-output heart failure (severe anemia, due to AV fistulas, pregnancy, severe thiamine deficiency) Heart Failure with preserved Ejection Fraction (HFpEF) or diastolic dysfunction Owing to impaired ventricular filling during diastole (either impaired relaxation or increased stiffness of ventricle or both). Echocardiogram shows impaired relaxation of left ventricle. Causes include: HTN leading to myocardial hypertrophy\u2014most common cause of diastolic dysfunction Valvular diseases such as aortic stenosis (AS), mitral stenosis, and aortic regurgitation Restrictive cardiomyopathy (e.g., amyloidosis, sarcoidosis, hemochromatosis in their early phases) Obstructive cardiomyopathy HOCM Left-sided vs. Right-sided heart failure determines symptoms Clinical features Symptoms of left-sided heart failure Forward failure: Confusion and memory impairment occur in advanced CHF as a result of inadequate brain perfusion Diaphoresis and cool extremities at rest\u2014occur in desperately ill patients (NYHA class IV) Backwards failure Dyspnea\u2014difficulty breathing secondary to pulmonary congestion/edema Orthopnea\u2014difficulty breathing in the recumbent position; relieved by elevation of the head with pillows Paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea (PND)\u2014awakening after 1 to 2 hours of sleep due to acute shortness of breath (SOB) Nocturnal cough (nonproductive)\u2014worse in recumbent position (same pathophysiology as orthopnea) Signs of left-sided heart failure Displaced PMI (usually to the left) due to cardiomegaly Pathologic S3 (ventricular gallop) - indicative of a systolic heart failure (splashing into leftover blood) Rapid filling phase \u201cinto\u201d a noncompliant left ventricular chamber May be normal finding in children; in adults, usually associated with CHF May be difficult to hear, but is among the most specific signs of CHF Heard best at apex with bell of stethoscope The sequence in the cardiac cycle for S3: S3 follows S2 (ken-tuck-Y) S4 gallop - indicative of a diastolic heart failure (pushing blood into a stiff ventricle) Sound of atrial systole as blood is ejected into a noncompliant, or stiff, left ventricular chamber Heard best at left sternal border with bell of stethoscope The sequence in the cardiac cycle for S4: S4 precedes S1 (TEN-nes-see) Crackles/rales at lung bases Caused by fluid spilling into alveoli; indicates pulmonary edema Rales heard over lung bases suggest at least moderate severity of left ventricular heart failure Dullness to percussion and decreased tactile fremitus of lower lung fields caused by pleural effusion \u2192 fluid in the pleural space will absorb all the sound Increased intensity of pulmonic component of second heart sound suggests pulmonary HTN (heard over left upper sternal border) Symptoms/signs of right-sided heart failure Backwards failure: Peripheral pitting edema\u2014pedal edema lacks specificity as an isolated finding.

Useful in determining whether systolic or diastolic dysfunction predominates, and determines whether the cause of CHF is due to a myocardial, valvular, or pericardial process. Estimates EF (very important): Patients with systolic dysfunction (EF <40%) should be distinguished from patients with preserved left ventricular function (EF >40%). Shows chamber dilation and/or hypertrophy. B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) is released from the ventricles in response to ventricular volume expansion and pressure overload. BNP levels >100 pg/mL correlate strongly with the presence of decompensated CHF. (Unit of measurement varies.) BNP may be useful in differentiating between dyspnea caused by CHF and COPD. N-terminal pro-BNP (NT-proBNP) is a newer assay with similar predictive value as BNP. The normal range for this value depends on the age of the patient, but an NT-proBNP <300 virtually excludes the diagnosis of HF. BNP may be falsely low in obese patients. ECG is usually nonspecific but can be useful for detecting chamber enlargement and presence of ischemic heart disease or prior MI. Radionuclide ventriculography using technetium-99m (\u201cnuclear ventriculography\u201d). Also called multigated acquisition (MUGA) scan. Cardiac catheterization can provide valuable quantitative information regarding diastolic and systolic dysfunction, and can clarify the cause of CHF if noninvasive test results are equivocal. Consider coronary angiography to exclude CAD as an underlying cause of CHF. Stress testing Identifies ischemia and/or infarction Quantifies level of conditioning Can differentiate cardiac versus pulmonary etiology of dyspnea Assesses dynamic responses of HR, heart rhythm, and BP Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) Management Pharmacotherapy for HFrEF as recommended by eTG: ACEi & Beta-blockers & Spironolactone FIRST - MORTALITY LOWERING DRUGS Serum sodium, potassium, renal function and blood pressure should be measured prior to starting a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist and with every dose increase.

Goal is relief of signs and symptoms of volume overload (dyspnea, peripheral edema) Loop diuretics: Furosemide (Lasix)\u2014usually used.

Most valves with vegetations have associated thickening or regurgitation.

Healed vegetations have central fibroblastic proliferation and fibrosis, neovascularization, minimal or no inflammatory cell deposition, and peripherally a hyalinized and endothelialized thrombus or no thrombus.

The valve vegetations are usually sessile, are less than 1 cm2 in size, have irregular borders and heterogeneous echodensity, and have no independent motion. Most valves with vegetations have associated thickening or regurgitation. Although valve vegetations have been seen more commonly in younger persons (< 40 years), their temporal association with SLE activity, severity, duration, and therapy has been variable.","title":"Background"},{"location":"IM/Cardiology/Libman-Sacks%20Endocarditis%20%28Nonbacterial%20Verrucous%20Endocarditis%29.html#pathology","text":"Pathologic examination reveals that active Libman-Sacks vegetations have central myxoid degeneration, fibrinoid necrosis, and hemorrhages surrounded by predominant polymorphonuclear cellular infiltration and, peripherally, by platelet or fibrin thrombus.

His cardiac examination is normal with no murmurs and normal heart sounds. An ECG reveals ST segment elevation in the lateral precordial leads, and cardiac enzymes show evidence of myocardial injury. He undergoes emergent cardiac catheterization that shows a thrombus in the left circumflex artery. He undergoes successful angioplasty, and a stent is placed. He is monitored in the cardiac intensive care unit. He does well until the next day, when he develops sudden shortness of breath and decreasing oxygen saturations. Physical examination now reveals jugular venous distention, rales at both lung bases, and a blowing holosystolic murmur loudest at the apex, radiating into the axilla. Questions What likely accounts for this patient\u2019s sudden decompensation? Sudden development of SOB likely indicates an acute process \u2192 papillary muscle rupture or chordae tendinae rupture can explain the new onset mitral regurgitation The patient\u2019s decompensation was likely triggered by the development of acute mitral regurgitation. The leaflets of the mitral valve are tethered by chordae tendineae, which are in turn attached to the ventricular wall by papillary muscles. The papillary muscles derive their blood supply from the left circumflex coronary artery and can become ischemic and even rupture if the blood supply is interrupted. When this happens, the leaflet is no longer tethered, and the valve no longer closes with systole, resulting in the sudden development of acute mitral regurgitation. What is the main pathophysiologic derangement in this condition? Post MI \u2192 mechanical complications including papillary muscle or chordae tendinae rupture due to recent area of infarct \u2192 LV regurgitation into LA \u2192 LA fluid overload \u2192 backflow and engorgement of pulmonary vasculature \u2192 jugular venous distension and lung base rales. Blowing holosystolic murmur due to regurgitation of blood in ventricular systole. In mitral regurgitation, blood regurgitates into the left atrium from the left ventricle during systole. This leads to both volume and pressure overload of the left atrium, which in turn is transmitted to the pulmonary vasculature. It can also lead to dilation of the atrium and disruption of the heart\u2019s electrical system, causing arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation. The increased pulmonary pressures can lead to heart failure. Also, in contrast to mitral stenosis, there is also an element of volume overload on the left ventricle, as the regurgitant blood from the left atrium flows back into the left ventricle during diastole. What changes in the heart take place if this condition develops slowly rather than suddenly? Slow development of a mitral regurgitation will likely result in LA hypertrophy (eccentric) and development of atrial fibrillation. If mitral regurgitation develops more slowly, the heart has a chance to adapt to the increased volume. The left ventricle, in particular, can dilate and hypertrophy in response to the increased stroke volume (though usually not to the extent that this left ventricular dilation and hypertrophy happen in aortic regurgitation). As a result, the apical impulse becomes displaced to the left.","title":"Mitral Regurgitation"},{"location":"IM/Cardiology/Mitral%20Regurgitation.html#mitral-regurgitation","text":"","title":"Mitral Regurgitation"},{"location":"IM/Cardiology/Mitral%20Regurgitation.html#background","text":"Causes Acute Endocarditis (most often Staphylococcus aureus) Papillary muscle rupture (from infarction) or dysfunction (from ischemia) Chordae tendineae rupture Chronic Mitral valve prolapse (MVP) Rheumatic fever Marfan syndrome Cardiomyopathy causing dilation of mitral annulus Etiology (Primary/secondary) Primary MR Degenerative mitral valve disease ( mitral valve prolapse , mitral annular calcification, ruptured chordae tendineae ) Rheumatic fever Infective endocarditis Secondary (functional) MR Coronary artery disease, prior myocardial infarction causing papillary muscle involvement Dilated cardiomyopathy and left-sided heart failure","title":"Background"},{"location":"IM/Cardiology/Mitral%20Regurgitation.html#pathology","text":"Pathophysiology Acute Abrupt elevation of left atrial pressure in the setting of normal LA size and compliance, causing backflow into pulmonary circulation with resultant pulmonary edema Cardiac output decreases because of decreased forward flow, so hypotension and shock can occur Chronic Gradual elevation of left atrial pressure in the setting of dilated LA and LV (with increased left atrial compliance) LV dysfunction occurs due to dilation.

The redundant leaflet(s) prolapse toward the LA in systole, which results in the auscultated click and murmur. MVP is common in patients with genetic connective tissue disorders, such as Marfan syndrome, osteogenesis imperfecta, and Ehlers\u2013Danlos syndrome. MVP is a common cause of MR in developed countries. Arrhythmias and sudden death are very rare.

It may lead to total occlusion of a coronary vessel. - i.e. a clot in the process of being formed Clinical features The following patients may be said to have unstable angina Patients with chronic angina with increasing frequency, duration, or intensity of chest pain Patients with new-onset angina that is severe and worsening Patients with angina at rest Diagnostic criteria Perform a diagnostic workup to exclude MI in all patients.

PACS arising close to the AV node (\u201clow atrial\u201d ectopics) activate the atria retrogradely, producing an inverted P wave with a relatively short PR interval \u2265 120 ms (PR interval < 120 ms is classified as a PJC). PACs that reach the SA node may depolarise it, causing the SA node to \u201creset\u201d \u2014 this results in a longer-than-normal interval before the next sinus beat arrives (\u201cpost-extrasystolic pause\u201d). Unlike with PVCs, this pause is not equal to double the preceding RR interval (i.e. not a \u201cfull compensatory pause\u201d). PACs arriving early in the cycle may be conducted aberrantly, usually with a RBBB morphology (as the right bundle branch has a longer refractory period than the left). They can be differentiated from PVCs by the presence of a preceding P wave. Similarly, PACs arriving very early in the cycle may not be conducted to the ventricles at all. In this case, you will see an abnormal P wave that is not followed by a QRS complex (\u201cblocked PAC\u201d). It is usually followed by a compensatory pause as the sinus node resets. Classification of Premature Atrial Complex (PAC) PACs may be either: Unifocal \u2013 Arising from a single ectopic focus; each PAC is identical. Multifocal \u2013 Arising from two or more ectopic foci; multiple P-wave morphologies. PACs often occur in repeating patterns: Bigeminy \u2014 every other beat is a PAC.

Most cases are due to acute coronary thrombosis: Atheromatous plaque ruptures into the vessel lumen, and thrombus forms on top of this lesion, which causes occlusion of the vessel. MI is associated with a 30% mortality rate; half of the deaths are prehospital. Most deaths are due to a new onset arrhythmia Most patients with MI have history of angina, risk factors for CAD, or history of arrhythmias. Pathology Clinical features Chest pain Intense substernal pressure sensation; often described as \u201ccrushing\u201d and \u201can elephant standing on my chest.\u201d Radiation to neck, jaw, arms, or back, commonly to the left side. Similar to angina pectoris in character and distribution but much more severe and lasts longer. Unlike in angina, pain may not respond to nitroglycerin. Some patients may have epigastric discomfort. Can be asymptomatic in up to one-third of patients; painless infarcts or atypical presentations more likely in postoperative patients, the elderly, diabetic patients, and women and indigenous australians. Other symptoms Dyspnea Diaphoresis Weakness, fatigue Nausea and vomiting Sense of impending doom Syncope Sudden cardiac death\u2014usually due to ventricular fibrillation (VFib) Diagnostic criteria Investigations ECG Markers for ischemia/infarction include Peaked T waves: Occur very early and may be missed ST-segment elevation indicates transmural injury and can be diagnostic of an acute infarct Q waves: Evidence for necrosis (specific)\u2014Q waves are usually seen late; typically not seen acutely T-wave inversion is sensitive but not specific ST-segment depression: Subendocardial injury 2mm in 2+ continguous anterior leads OR 1mm elevation in limb leads OR new LBBB Categories of infarcts ST-segment elevation infarct: Transmural (involves entire thickness of wall); tends to be larger Non\u2013ST-segment elevation infarct: Subendocardial (involves inner one-third to one-half of the wall); tends to be smaller, and presentation is similar to UA \u2014cardiac enzymes differentiate the two Cardiac enzymes\u2014currently the diagnostic gold standard for myocardial injury Troponins (Troponin I and T)\u2014most important enzyme test to order Increases within 3 to 5 hours and returns to normal in 5 to 14 days; reaches a peak in 24 to 48 hours. Greater sensitivity and specificity than CK-MB for myocardial injury. Obtain serum levels of either troponin T or troponin I on admission, and again every 6 hours for 18 to 24 hours. Troponin I can be falsely elevated in patients with renal failure; thus following trend of levels is important. CK-MB\u2014less commonly used Increases within 4 to 8 hours and returns to normal in 48 to 72 hours; reaches a peak in 24 hours. When measured within 24 to 36 hours of onset of chest pain, has greater than 95% sensitivity and specificity. Levels of total CK and CK-MB should be measured on admission and every 8 hours thereafter for 24 hours. Most helpful in detecting recurrent infarction given quicker return to baseline than troponin. Remember the PAILS mnemonic when assessing for reciprocal changes: PAILS stands for P-posterior A-anterior I-inferior L-lateral S-septal. ST elevations in these leads most commonly create reciprocal ST depressions in the corresponding leads of the next letter in the mnemonic. Management Admit patient to a cardiac monitored floor (CCU) and establish IV access. Give supplemental oxygen for hypoxia and analgesics Medical therapy DAPT Aspirin Antiplatelet agent reduces coronary reocclusion by inhibiting platelet aggregation on top of the thrombus Has been shown to reduce mortality and should be part of long-term maintenance therapy P2Y12 inhibitors (clopidogrel, ticagrelor) Used in conjunction with aspirin; have been shown to reduce recurrent MI Ticagrelor has improved mortality compared to clopidogrel in the PLATO trial (its use is limited by cost, frequent dosing, and common side effect of dyspnea). Duration of therapy depends on decision to perform PCI versus CABG, risk factors of patient Use 600mg if getting PCI, 300mg if getting tPA Heparin Initiate in all patients with MI; prevents progression of thrombus; however, has not been shown to decrease mortality LMWH, specifically enoxaparin, is preferred over unfractionated heparin, as shown in the ExTRACT-TIMI 25 trial as well as a recent meta-analysis. Enoxaparin was shown to decrease the risk of recurrent MI versus unfractionated heparin. Heparin is used in the case of severe kidney failure GPIIb/IIIa inhibitor is also given if the patient is to recieve a PCA - epitifibatide, abciximab, tirofiban \u03b2-Blockers - use atenolol or metoprolol (unless LVF, low LVEF, where bisoprolol, carvedilol, nebivolol, metoprolol succinate are preferred) Block stimulation of HR and contractility to reduce oxygen demand and decrease the incidence of arrhythmias Reduce remodeling of the myocardium post-MI Have been shown to reduce mortality and should be part of maintenance therapy ACE inhibitors Initiate within hours of hospitalization if there are no contraindications Have been shown to reduce mortality and should be part of long-term maintenance therapy Statins Reduce risk of further coronary events Stabilize plaques and lower cholesterol The PROVE IT-TIMI 22 trial showed the superiority of starting atorvastatin 80 mg over other statins before discharging a STEMI patient Should be part of maintenance therapy Oxygen May limit ischemic myocardial injury in hypoxic patients. Does not improve mortality in patients with normal oxygen saturation. Nitrates Dilate coronary arteries (increase supply) and reduce chest pain Venodilation (decrease preload and thus demand) Care must be taken if there is an inferior infarct, or if there is evident hypotension (these are contraindications) Morphine Analgesia Causes venodilation, which decreases preload and thus oxygen requirements May mask severity of symptoms, may affect levels of antiplatelet drugs Sprionolactone is given if post-MI patient is high risk (e.g. HF, LV dysfunction, diabetic) NOTE: do NOT use GP2b3a inhibitors (tirofiban, abciximab) Revascularization Benefit highest when performed early (within 90 minutes of hospital arrival for patients with STEMI or new LBBB) Should be considered in all patients. Revascularization options include thrombolysis, PCI, or CABG Several studies have shown enhanced survival and lower rates of recurrent MI and intracranial bleeding when PCI performed by skilled personnel is chosen over thrombolysis. For patients with a delayed presentation, fibrinolysis alone may be a better option. Urgent/emergent CABG is typically performed only in the setting of mechanical complications of an acute MI, cardiogenic shock, life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, or after failure of PCI. It is almost never performed in the acute setting on a stable patient. Given early enough PCI/revascularisation, troponin levels (indicative of infract) may not necessarily rise, resulting in an 'aborted STEMI' P2Y12 inhibitors evidence suggests that the benefit of clopidogrel or ticagrelor is additive to the effects of aspirin. Clopidogrel or ticagrelor therapy should be initiated in all patients who undergo PCI and receive a stent. Dual antiplatelet treatment with aspirin and a P2Y12 inhibitor (clopidogrel or ticagrelor) should continue for at least 30 days in patients who receive a bare metal stent, and at least 12 months in patients who receive a drug-eluting stent. Rehabilitation Cardiac rehabilitation is a physician-supervised regimen of exercise and risk factor reduction after MI. Shown to reduce symptoms and prolong survival. Complications Pump failure (congestive heart failure [CHF]) Most common cause of in-hospital mortality If mild, treat medically (ACE inhibitor, diuretic) If severe, may lead to cardiogenic shock; invasive hemodynamic monitoring or support with inotropes or devices may be indicated (see Cardiogenic Shock on page 64) Arrhythmias Ventricular arrhythmias are the most common cause of death post-MI Premature ventricular contractions (PVCs)\u2014conservative treatment (observation) indicated; no need for antiarrhythmic agents Atrial fibrillation (AFib) Ventricular tachycardia (VT)\u2013sustained VT requires treatment: If patient is hemodynamically unstable, electrical cardioversion is indicated. If patient is hemodynamically stable, start antiarrhythmic therapy\u2014see treatment of VT VFib\u2014immediate unsynchronized defibrillation and CPR are indicated Accelerated idioventricular rhythm does not affect prognosis; no treatment needed in most cases Paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT) Sinus tachycardia May be caused by pain, anxiety, fever, pericarditis, medications, etc. Worsens ischemia (increases myocardial oxygen consumption) Treat underlying cause (analgesics for pain, acetaminophen for fever, etc.) Sinus bradycardia A common occurrence in early stages of acute MI, especially rightsided/ inferior MI. May be a protective mechanism (reduces myocardial oxygen demand). No treatment is required other than observation. If bradycardia is severe or symptomatic (hemodynamic compromise), atropine may be helpful in increasing HR. Asystole Very high mortality. Treatment should begin with electrical defibrillation for VFib, which is more common in cardiac arrest and may be difficult to clearly differentiate from asystole. If asystole is clearly the cause of arrest, transcutaneous pacing is the appropriate treatment. AV block Associated with ischemia involving conduction tracts. First- and second-degree (type I) blocks do not require therapy. Second- (type II) and third-degree blocks: Prognosis is dire in the setting of an anterior MI\u2014emergent placement of a temporary pacemaker is indicated (with later placement of a permanent pacemaker). In inferior MI, prognosis is better, and IV atropine may be used initially. If conduction is not restored, a temporary pacemaker is appropriate . Can use positive chronotropic medications to maintain HR and blood pressures (i.e., isoproterenol or dopamine) while awaiting placement of temporary pacemaker. Recurrent infarction (extension of existing infarction or reinfarction of a new area) Both short- and long-term mortality are increased. Diagnosis is often difficult. Cardiac enzymes are already elevated from the initial infarction. Troponin levels remain elevated for a week or more, so are not useful here. CK-MB returns to normal faster, and so a reelevation of CK-MB after 36 to 48 hours may be due to recurrent infarction. If there is repeat ST-segment elevation on ECG within the first 24 hours after infarction, suspect recurrent infarction or LV aneurysm. Treatment: Repeat thrombolysis or urgent cardiac catheterization and PCI. Continue standard medical therapy for MI. Following inferior wall MI, 40% of people will also have a RV infarct (inferior wall and RV all come from right coronary artery in a right-dominant patient) - will see: - clear lungs \u2192 pulmonary oedema occurs due to a failure of the LV - RV leads - hypotension This is a particular concern for future surgeries - Stress testing is typically warranted, however with poor functional capacity, radionuclide myocardial perfusion imaging is also acceptable A radionuclide myocardial perfusion imaging is indicated for the preoperative risk stratification in this patient. It may be performed with the patient exercising or by using a drug that increases myocardial perfusion (e.g., dipyridamole). Because of this patient's poor functional capacity, dipyridamole should be used. A dobutamine stress echocardiography would be an alternative test to radionuclide scan with dipyridamole as it can also be used in patients with poor functional capacity. Mechanical complications Free wall rupture A catastrophic, usually fatal event that occurs during the first 2 weeks after MI (90% within 2 weeks, most commonly 1 to 4 days after MI) 90% mortality rate Usually leads to hemopericardium and cardiac tamponade Treatment: Hemodynamic stabilization, immediate pericardiocentesis, and surgical repair Rupture of interventricular septum Greater potential for successful therapy than with a free wall rupture, although this is also a critical event; emergent surgery is indicated Occurs within 10 days after MI Likelihood of survival correlates with size of the defect RALES present, no murmur (due to large opening, as opposed to small VSD which causes the murmur) I ncreased O2 saturation between RA and RV (due to movement of oxygenated blood into RV) Papillary muscle rupture (same effect as valve rupture) Produces acute MR (presents with new murmur) If suspected, obtain an echocardiogram immediately Emergent surgery is needed (mitral valve replacement is usually necessary), as well as afterload reduction with sodium nitroprusside or intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) RALES due to pushing of fluid by ventricles into the pulmonary vasculature Ventricular pseudoaneurysm Incomplete free wall rupture (myocardial rupture is contained by pericardium) Bedside echocardiogram may show the pseudoaneurysm Surgical emergency because ventricular pseudoaneurysms tend to become a free wall rupture, risk of pericarditis and cardiac tamponade Ventricular aneurysm Rarely rupture (in contrast to pseudoaneurysms) Associated with a high incidence of ventricular tachyarrhythmias Medical management may be protective Surgery to remove aneurysm may be appropriate in selected patients Valve rupture (like papillary muscle rupture) presents with RALES, dyspnoea, tachycardia and new murmur confirm with echocardiography Tx: ACEi +/- surgery Acute pericarditis The incidence has decreased sharply since the introduction of revascularization techniques. Will present with an acute pleuritic and positional chest pain with diffuse ST elevation, and a concave J-point Treatment consists of aspirin (which is already standard in treatment of MI). NSAIDs and corticosteroids are contraindicated (may hinder myocardial scar formation). Dressler syndrome (\u201cpostmyocardial infarction syndrome\u201d) Immunologically based syndrome consisting of fever, malaise, pericarditis, leukocytosis, and pleuritis, occurring weeks to months after an MI Aspirin is the most effective therapy. Ibuprofen is a second option. Cardiac Tamponade Sudden loss of pulse (pulseless electrical activity) Beck's triad: Hypotension, Muffled heart sounds, Raised JVP Left bundle branch block A new-onset left bundle branch block (LBBB) on ECG in association with typical symptoms of acute myocardial infarction is diagnostic of an ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), as the presence of an LBBB often masks ST elevations. If a myocardial infarction involves > 40% of the myocardium it often leads to cardiogenic shock, as seen in this patient. Acute myocardial infarction is a common postsurgical complication, particularly in those with a history of atherosclerotic disease.

Also, patients with ischemic pain do not have chest wall tenderness. If any of these are present, the pain is less likely to be due to ischemia. (i.e. not positional, pleuritic or tender) Diagnostic criteria Note that physical examination in most patients with CAD is normal Resting ECG Usually normal in patients with stable angina Q waves are consistent with a prior MI If ST-segment or T-wave abnormalities are present during an episode of chest pain, then treat as unstable angina. (Unstable anginas do NOT have a rising troponin level) Stress test\u2014useful for patients with an intermediate pretest probability of CAD based upon age, gender, and symptoms. Stress ECG Highest sensitivity if patients have normal resting ECG, such that changes can be noted. Patients with baseline ECG abnormalities such as left bundle branch block (LBBB), pre-existing ST-segment changes, or left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), should NOT undergo stress ECG testing. Abnormal ECG \u2192 Stress echocardiography Test involves recording ECG before, during, and after exercise on a treadmill. 75% sensitive if patients are able to exercise sufficiently to increase heart rate to 85% of maximum predicted value for age. A person\u2019s maximum heart rate is calculated by subtracting age from 220 (220 \u2212 age). Exercise-induced ischemia results in subendocardial ischemia, producing ST segment depression. So the detection of ischemia on a stress ECG test is based on the presence of ST-segment depression. Other positive findings include onset of heart failure or ventricular arrhythmia during exercise or hypotension. Patients with a positive stress test result should undergo cardiac catheterization. Stress echocardiography Performed before and immediately after exercise. Exercise-induced ischemia is evidenced by wall motion abnormalities (e.g., akinesis or hypokinesis) not present at rest. This study is less reliable in patients with existing wall motion abnormalities or lowered EF. Abnormal echocardiograhy \u2192 Stress myocardial perfusion Favored by many cardiologists over stress ECG. It is more sensitive in detecting ischemia, can assess LV size and function, can diagnose valvular disease, and can be used to identify CAD in the presence of pre-existing ECG abnormalities Again, patients with a positive test result should undergo cardiac catheterization. Information gained from a stress test can be enhanced by stress myocardial perfusion imaging after IV administration of a radioisotope such as thallium-201 during exercise. Viable myocardial cells extract the radioisotope from the blood. No radioisotope uptake means no blood flow to an area of the myocardium. It is important to determine whether the ischemia is reversible, that is, whether areas of hypoperfusion are perfused over time as blood flow eventually equalizes. Areas of reversible ischemia may be rescued with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or coronary artery bypass graft (CABG). Irreversible ischemia, however, indicates infarcted tissue that cannot be salvaged. Perfusion imaging increases the sensitivity and specificity of exercise stress tests, but is also more expensive, subjects the patient to radiation, and is often not helpful in the presence of an LBBB. Only do stress test for people who you aren't certain about having CAD If the patient cannot exercise, perform a pharmacologic stress test. IV adenosine, dipyridamole, or dobutamine can be used. The cardiac stress induced by these agents takes the place of exercise. This can be combined with an ECG, an echocardiogram, or nuclear perfusion imaging. IV adenosine and dipyridamole cause generalized coronary vasodilation. Since diseased coronary arteries are already maximally dilated at rest to increase blood flow, they receive relatively less blood flow when the entire coronary system is pharmacologically vasodilated. These agents are used for perfusion imaging. This is called the coronary steal mechanism Dobutamine increases myocardial oxygen demand by increasing heart rate, blood pressure, and cardiac contractility. This is typically used in stress echo studies. Cardiac catheterization with coronary angiography Coronary angiography\u2014definitive test for CAD. Often performed with concurrent PCI or for patients being considered for revascularization with CABG. This is the test of choice for patients with very high pre-test probability of CAD. Contrast is injected into coronary vessels to visualize any stenotic lesions. This defines the location and extent of coronary disease. If CAD is severe (e.g., left main or three-vessel disease, or two-vessel disease with concurrent DM), refer patient for surgical revascularization (CABG) if CAD is NOT severe (1- or 2- vessel), use Aspirin, beta blockers, statins, ACEi Investigations Management Risk factor modification Smoking cessation cuts CAD risk in half by 1 year after quitting. HTN\u2014vigorous BP control reduces the risk of CAD, especially in diabetic patients. Hyperlipidemia\u2014reduction in serum cholesterol with lifestyle modifications and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) reduce CAD risk. Again, goal LDL is <70 mg/dL in patients with known CAD. DM\u2014type II diabetes is considered to be a cardiovascular heart disease equivalent, and strict glycemic control should be strongly emphasized. Obesity\u2014weight loss modifies other risk factors (diabetes, HTN, and hyperlipidemia) and provides other health benefits. Exercise is critical; it minimizes emotional stress, promotes weight loss, and helps reduce other risk factors. Diet: Reduce intake of saturated fat (<7% total calories) and cholesterol (<200 mg/day).

It is estimated that up to 70% of normal adults have mild, physiologic TR as seen on high-resolution echocardiography. A much smaller percentage of people are actually symptomatic. Causes\u2014up to 90% of cases occur in people with anatomically normal valve leaflets and chords. TR is usually secondary to RV dilation. Any cause of RV dilation can result in enlargement of the tricuspid orifice. Left ventricular failure is the most common cause. Right ventricular infarction. Inferior wall MI. Cor pulmonale, secondary to pulmonary HTN. Tricuspid endocarditis\u2014seen in IV drug users. May be secondary to rheumatic heart disease; usually accompanied by mitral and aortic valve disease. Ebstein anomaly\u2014congenital malformation of tricuspid valve in which there is downward displacement of the valve into the RV.

Your surgeon may perform valve repair by separating tethered valve leaflets, closing holes in leaflets, or reshaping the valve leaflets so that they can make contact with each other and prevent backward flow. Surgeons may often tighten or reinforce the ring around a valve (annulus) by implanting an artificial ring.

May lead to a paroxysmal tachycardia, which can be produced by two possible mechanisms: Orthodromic reciprocating tachycardia (orthodromic AVRT) The impulse travels through the AV node (anterograde limb) and depolarizes the ventricles. Then it travels back through the accessory pathway (the retrograde limb) and depolarizes the atria again, creating a reentry loop. No delta waves because conduction occurs retrograde over the accessory pathway. Supraventricular tachycardias (AFib or atrial flutter) Usually, AV node only allows certain impulses to get to ventricles. With an accessory pathway, all or most of the impulses may pass to the ventricles. A fast ventricular rate may occur and cause hemodynamic compromise. Associated disorders HOCM mitral valve prolapse Ebstein's anomaly thyrotoxicosis secundum ASD B. Diagnosis ECG: Narrow complex tachycardia, a short PR interval (usually <100 ms), and a delta wave (upward deflection seen before the QRS complex) C. Treatment Radiofrequency catheter ablation of one arm of the reentrant loop (i.e., of the accessory pathway) is an effective treatment. Medical options include procainamide or quinidine. Avoid drugs active on the AV node (e.g., digoxin, CCBs, \u03b2-blockers, adenosine) because they may accelerate conduction through the accessory pathway, resulting in VFib. Type IA antiarrhythmics (i.e., procainamide , disopyramide, quinidine ) are better choices, as they will suppress conduction through the accessory pathway instead. Pathophysiology case study A 25-year-old man presents to the hospital with light-headedness and palpitations for the past 2 hours. He had four or five previous episodes of palpitations in the past, but they had lasted only a few minutes and went away on their own. These episodes were not associated with any specific activity or diet. He denies any chest pain. On physical examination, he is noted to be tachycardic with a heart rate of 180 bpm and a blood pressure of 105/70 mm Hg. An ECG shows a narrow complex tachycardia at 180 bpm. The tachycardia terminates suddenly, and the patient\u2019s heart rate drops to 90 bpm. A repeat ECG shows sinus rhythm with a short PR interval and a wide QRS with a slurred upstroke (delta wave). The patient is diagnosed as having Wolff\u2013Parkinson\u2013White syndrome. Questions What is the significance of the delta wave on this patient\u2019s ECG? The delta wave is indicative of the slow depolarisation of the ventricles through the bundle of kent (or a result of the electrical leakage via the bundle of kent?) The atrioventricular (AV) node normally forms the only electrical connection between the atria and the ventricles. However, an accessory AV connection is found in approximately 1 in 1000 persons. This accessory pathway is usually composed of normal atrial or ventricular tissue. Because part of the ventricle is \u201cpre-excited\u201d over the accessory pathway, rather than via the AV node, the surface ECG shows a short PR interval and a relatively wide QRS with a slurred upstroke, termed a delta wave. How are re-entrant tachycardias initiated in this condition? Re-entrant tachycardias result from the pre-excitation of the LA (and thus AV node) by leakage currents from the LV via the bundle of kent Because the atria and ventricles are linked by two parallel connections, re-entrant tachycardias are readily initiated. For example, a premature atrial contraction could be blocked in the accessory pathway but still conduct to the ventricles via the AV node. If enough time has elapsed that the accessory pathway has recovered excitability, the cardiac impulse can travel in retrograde fashion to the atria over the accessory pathway and initiate a re-entrant tachycardia. What are two other mechanisms that give rise to tachycardias? AVNRT - resulting from fast/slow nodal conduction at the AV node First, an increased automaticity resulting from more rapid phase 4 depolarizations can cause rapid heart rate. Second, if repolarization is delayed (longer plateau period), spontaneous depolarizations (caused by the reactivation of sodium or calcium channels) can sometimes occur in phase 3 or phase 4 of the action potential. These depolarizations are called \u201ctriggered activity\u201d because they depend on the existence of a preceding action potential. If these depolarizations reach threshold, tachycardia can occur in certain pathologic conditions.","title":"Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) Syndrome"},{"location":"IM/Cardiology/Wolff-Parkinson-White%20%28WPW%29%20Syndrome.html#wolff-parkinson-white-wpw-syndrome","text":"","title":"Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) Syndrome"},{"location":"IM/Cardiology/Wolff-Parkinson-White%20%28WPW%29%20Syndrome.html#general-characteristics","text":"An accessory conduction pathway from atria to ventricles through the bundle of Kent causes premature ventricular excitation because it lacks the delay seen in the AV node.

When urine osmolality is stable (<30 mOsm/kg hourly increase for 3 hours), inject 2 g desmopressin subcutaneously. Measure urine osmolality 1 hour later.

Spirono is still the preferred first-line treatment) \u2022 Note that these patients may be on a non-K-sparing diuretic simply because they seem to have hypertension.

Elevated levels lead to water retention and excretion of concentrated urine. This has two major effects: hyponatremia and volume expansion. Despite volume expansion, edema is not seen in syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH). This is because natriuresis (excretion of excessive sodium in urine) occurs despite hyponatremia. Reasons for natriuresis Volume expansion causes an increase in atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) which increases urine sodium excretion.

Cancer is found in 4% to 10% of nodules that are investigated. 2. A solitary nodule can be either thyroid cancer or a benign adenoma. However, multinodular conditions may cause confusion because only one of these nodules may be palpable. 3. The most important function of the physical examination is the detection of the thyroid nodule, rather than the determination of its benign or malignant status. 4. To be detectable on palpation, a nodule must be at least 1 cm in diameter. 5. Malignancy is suggested by the following: a. If the nodule is fixed in place and no movement occurs on swallowing b. Unusually firm consistency or irregularity of the nodule c. If the nodule is solitary d. History of radiation therapy to the neck e. History of rapid development f. Vocal cord paralysis (recurrent laryngeal nerve paralysis) g. Cervical adenopathy h. Elevated serum calcitonin i. Family history of thyroid cancer B. Diagnosis 1. Initial workup should include history, physical exam, ultrasound of neck and TSH. 2. Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy (see also Clinical Pearl 4-9) a. FNA has a sensitivity of 95% and a specificity of 95%. Therefore, if FNA shows a benign nodule, the nodule is likely to be benign. b. However, FNA biopsies have 5% false-negative results, so follow up with periodic FNA if thyroid nodularity persists. Benign lesions should continue to show consistently benign cytology. c. FNA is reliable for all cancers (papillary, medullary, anaplastic) except follicular. 3. Thyroid scan (radioactive iodine) (Figure 4-5) a. Thyroid scan plays a supplemental role. It is performed if the FNA biopsy is indeterminate. It is also performed in patients with a low TSH, as these patients are more likely to have a hyperfunctioning nodule. b. It gives graphic representations of the distribution of radioactive iodine in the gland\u2014useful in identifying whether thyroid nodules show decreased (\u201ccold\u201d) or increased (\u201chot\u201d) accumulation of radioactive iodine compared with normal paranodular tissue. Nodules are classified as \u201ccold\u201d (hypofunctional), \u201cwarm\u201d (normally functioning), or \u201chot\u201d (hyperfunctional). c. It should be limited to patients whose FNA biopsy results suggest neoplasm. (It is not cost effective to scan all patients with thyroid nodules.)

Risk factors - Obesity (greatest risk factor) - Genetics - Age (insulin production decreases with age) b. Obesity plays a major role - Obesity is associated with increased plasma levels of free fatty acids, which make muscles more insulin resistant, reducing glucose uptake. - Therefore, obesity exacerbates insulin resistance. - In the liver, free fatty acids increase the production of glucose. c. Lack of compensation in type II diabetic patients - In normal individuals, the pancreas secretes more insulin in response to free fatty acids, thus neutralizing the excess glucose. - In type II diabetic patients, free fatty acids fail to stimulate pancreatic insulin secretion. Therefore, compensation does not occur and hyperglycemia develops; \u03b2-cells become desensitized to glucose, leading to decreased insulin secretion. Management Diet and exercise should ideally be the only interventions in most type II diabetic patients. a. Diet and exercise are especially effective in obese and sedentary patients (who constitute the majority of type II diabetic patients). b. Most patients, however, do not lose enough weight to control glucose levels through diet and exercise alone, and will require pharmacologic treatment. c. Glycemic control minimizes risks for nephropathy, neuropathy, and retinopathy in both Type 1 and 2 DM, and decreases risk for cardiovascular disease for Type 1 DM. Oral hypoglycemic drugs (see Table 4-4) a. Use these in type II diabetic patients when conservative therapy (diet and exercise) fails. b. Start with one agent; metformin is best initial drug therapy. If monotherapy fails, use two agents from different classes in combination. Each agent has advantages and disadvantages, so clinical judgment is required in selecting the agent. c.

There are numerous studies evaluating cardiovascular benefits of SGLT2 inhibitor therapy in high-risk CVD patients. f. In patients with relatively mild disease, use of these drugs (alone or in combination) can bring glucose levels to normal, but patients with severe disease often do not respond adequately.

First, endothelial damage occurs (in native valves this is typically due to turbulent blood flow), followed by adherence of platelets and fibrin to the damaged valve areas. These initially sterile platelet-fibrin aggregates can become infected by bacteria circulating in the blood, forming vegetations. recurrent dental abscesses \u2192 Streptococcal bacteraemia Microbial adherence to the platelet-fibrin nidus is mediated by interaction of bacterial cell wall components (e.g., dextrans) and the valvular endothelium. Fibrin clots encase this vegetation and subsequent destruction of the affected valves leads to valvular insufficiency. This patient's physical examination findings of splinter hemorrhages and Osler nodes represent areas of microembolization of vegetation material. Can develop on a valve previously affected by RHD, or congenitally deformed valve (e.g. BAV) or a normal valve - erosion/perforation of the leaflet(s) Risk factors for infective endocarditis IVDU Prosthetic heart valves Nosocomial endocarditis (e.g. due to line infection) Structural heart disease (e.g. BAV) Degenerative valvular lesions increase risk History of infective endocarditis (thus previously damaged heart valves) Pathology Acute disease (leading to valve insufficiency, septic embolic infarcts , tendinous cord rupture) Erosion \u2192 fibrin deposits on valves Ulceration Perforation \u2192 adaptation of valve edges not possible Chronic disease (leading to valve insufficiency and valve stenosis) Erosion \u2192 reorganisation of fibrin layer Granulation tissue \u2192 valve scarring/ fibrosis Calcification \u2192 thickened and/or shortened tendinous cords Organisms Native valve endocarditis Streptococcus viridans is the most common organism in native valve endocarditis. S. sanguinis is a gram-positive bacterium that belongs to the viridans streptococci group. Viridans streptococci are oral commensals and the most common cause of subacute endocarditis in damaged native valves (such as this patient's bicuspid aortic valve). S. sanguinis is also a common cause of endocarditis after oral procedures. S Anginosis, S. Sanguinis, S. mitis (including S. pneumoniae), S. salivarius, S. mutans Strep viridians tends to be subacute presenting, clinically presenting with 'sweats' and a low grade pyrexia Other common organisms include (2) Staphylococcus species (Staphylococcus aureus more commonly than Staphylococcus epidermidis) and Enterococci (A streptococcus) S. epidermidis has the ability to adhere to foreign bodies (e.g., intravenous catheters, pacemakers, prosthetic heart valves) and subsequently form a biofilm. The pathogen accounts for about 30% of health care-associated bloodstream infections, particularly those related to prosthetic material. Enterococcal streptococci infections tend to present in older patients with UTIs and possible previous endocarditis Streptococcus bovis is associated with increased risk of active colonic malignancy Malignant colonic polyps can develop into colon cancer. IE due to an infection with Streptococcus gallolyticus (formerly known as Streptococcus bovis biotype I, a group D Streptococci) is associated with an increased incidence of colonic neoplasms. HACEK group of organisms: Haemophilus, Actinobacillus, Cardiobacterium, Eikenella, and Kingella. Ceftriaxone is a third-generation cephalosporin that is effective against enteric gram-negative rods, including HACEK organisms such as C. hominis. Alternatively, other third-generation IV cephalosporins (e.g., cefotaxime) or a fourth generation (e.g., cefepime) can be used to treat infective endocarditis caused by HACEK organisms. Prosthetic valve endocarditis Early onset IE (within 2 months) Staphylococci are the most common causes of early-onset endocarditis; symptoms appear within 60 days of surgery (Staphylococcus epidermidis more commonly than Staphylococcus aureus). Staphylococcus epidermidis (Coagulase negative) is the most common cause of prosthetic valve endocarditis and is of particular concern in the first year after surgery. It forms a biofilm over the prosthetic valve and typically has an insidious onset with a subacute course (i.e., symptoms develop over weeks to months). IV combination therapy with nafcillin and rifampin can be used for at least 6 weeks in combination with gentamicin for 2 weeks to treat S. epidermidis prosthetic valve endocarditis, which requires a longer duration of therapy than native valve endocarditis. Surgical valve replacement may be required. Late onset IE (after 2 months) Coagulase negative staphylococci appear to still be the dominant cause of prosthetic valve IE even after 2 months Strep viridians becomes significantly more common than before (3% to 24%) Endocarditis in IV drug users Frequently presents with right-sided endocarditis. Staphylococcus aureus is the most common cause. Other organisms include Enterococci and Streptococci. Fungi (mostly Candida) and gram-negative rods (mostly Pseudomonas) are less common causes. Candida is more common in heroin users IV drug users are at an increased risk of tricuspid or multiple valvular involvement. Thrombi from the right heart most frequently dislodge into the lung, which puts the patient at risk of pulmonary embolism. Patients with left-sided (aortic valve or mitral valve) endocarditis more commonly present with emboli to the retina (Roth spots), extremities (Janeway lesions, Osler nodes, splinter hemorrhages), kidney, brain, and spleen. Classification Classifications (can be classified as acute or subacute) Acute endocarditis Most commonly caused by Staphylococcus aureus (highly virulent) Child pops a pimple - squeezes bacteria into blood, settles onto valve! Occurs on a normal heart valve If untreated, fatal in less than 6 weeks Subacute endocarditis Caused by less virulent organisms, such as Streptococcus viridans and Enterococcus Occurs on damaged heart valves If untreated, takes much longer than 6 weeks to cause death Clinical features Diagnostic criteria Investigations Labwork: FBC (normochromic normocytic anaemia, raised ESR/CRP), urinalysis, syphilis serology) High clinical suspicion of IE risk S. aureus bacteraemia \u2192 Vancomycin IV 6 weeks Enterococcus faecalis bacteraemia Viridians Streptococcus in \u22652 blood cultures unusual gram negative rods (E.g. haemophilus - HACEK) S. aureus in CSF or urine of febrile uncatheterised patient polyarticular septic arthritis (indicating haematogenous spread) Multiple blood cultures with coagulase negative staph Duke clinical criteria: Two major criteria, one major and three minor criteria, or five minor criteria are required to diagnose infective endocarditis. TTE is good for ruling in, but TOE is better for ruling in/out. Use TTE if low clinical suspicion UNLESS prosthetic valve involved \u2192 due to higher mortality and risk, TOE is preferred. Management Three sets of blood cultures should be drawn prior to initiating antibiotic therapy Parenteral antibiotics based on culture results for extended periods (4 to 6 weeks) If cultures are negative but there is high clinical suspicion, treat empirically with vancomycin plus an aminoglycoside (usually gentamicin) until the organism can be isolated Intravenous vancomycin therapy is the initial empiric antibiotic treatment in patients with native heart valves and suspected IE because its coverage includes MRSA. Empiric therapy is typically administered right after blood cultures are drawn. Native valve empiric therapy (ETG) \u2192 BFG (Benzylpenicillin, Flucloxacillin, Gentamicin) where BenPen can be replaced with Vancomycin if MRSA is suspected (i.e. VFG) Prosthetic valve (ETG) \u2192 VFG (Vancomycin, Flucloxacillin, Gentamycin) If patient has intracardiac devices such as pacemaker or ICD, these must be removed as they could be the source of infection Early surgical intervention is warranted for patients with native-valve IE (i.e. remove infective source) or medical failure acute heart failure due to valvular damage/dysfunction left-sided infective endocarditis with highly resistant organisms (including MRSA) infective endocarditis complicated by heart block or intracardiac abscess persistent bacteremia or fevers lasting 5 to 7 days after antibiotic initiation; presence of an abscess or fistula resulting in mechanical complications Severe aortic regurgitation or mitral regurgitation with progressive or severe LV dysfunction Often recommended if patients have had an embolic event, or there is a large >10mm mobile vegetation Surgery for prosthetic valve IE is generally the same criteria as above, or if there is a valve dysfunction because of the IE If there is a paravalvular infection Prophylaxis Scope of patients who qualify for prophylaxis is much narrower than in the past.

Perivalvular abscess should always be suspected if patients with infective endocarditis develop a new conduction abnormality. A third-degree AV block is a complete block with no conduction between the atria and ventricles. Various solid organ damage from showered emboli: Septic pulmonary emboli, intramuscular abscesses, Roth spots (retinal), Janeway lesions (microabscesses in extremities), septic arthritis, epidural spinal abscess, renal abscesses, cerebral emboli causing CVA or brain abscess Janeway lesions Glomerulonephritis Renal damage in IE is primarily caused by two mechanisms: Septic embolization can lead to renal artery occlusion with subsequent ischemia and renal damage, while the deposition of immunoglobulins and complement in the glomerulus can lead to glomerulonephritis. Although septic embolisms can cause renal injury (e.g., renal artery occlusion, glomerulonephritis) in IE, the complication is more common in left-sided involvement._ Osler nodes (immunologic depositions in extremities, painful), splinter hemorrhages in nail beds Painful nodules on the pads of the fingers (also known as Osler nodes) as a result of circulating immune complex deposition in the skin are a relatively rare but highly suggestive finding of IE.

or days, with an increase in serum creatinine level while the cutoff for rise in creatinine which qualifies as an \u201cinjury\u201d is controversial, an increase of as little as 0.3 mg/dL may have clinical relevance, while traditional definitions describe a relative increase of 50% or an absolute increase of 0.5 to 1.0 mg/dL). The creatinine may be normal despite a markedly reduced glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in the early stages of acute kidney injury (AKI) due to the time it takes for creatinine to accumulate in the body. This condition is also called acute renal failure (ARF). One consensus definition of AKI is called the RIFLE criteria. RISK: 1.5-fold increase in the serum creatinine or GFR decrease by 25% or urine output <0.5 mL/kg/hr for 6 hours. INJURY: Twofold increase in the serum creatinine or GFR decrease by 50% or urine output <0.5 mL/kg/hr for 12 hours. FAILURE: Threefold increase in the serum creatinine or GFR decrease by 75% or urine output of <0.5 mL/kg/hr for 24 hours, or anuria for 12 hours. LOSS: Complete loss of kidney function (i.e., requiring dialysis) for more than 4 weeks. ESRD: Complete loss of kidney function (i.e., requiring dialysis) for more than 3 months. Approach AKI may be nonoliguric, oliguric, or anuric. Severe AKI may occur without a reduction in urine output (nonoliguric AKI). General goals of therapy are reversing the initial insult to the kidney and/or supportive care as GFR recovers, as well as preventing fulminant kidney failure requiring temporary or permanent hemodialysis. Weight gain and edema are most common findings in patients with AKI. This is due to a positive water and sodium (Na+) balance. Characterized by azotemia (elevated BUN and Cr) Elevated BUN is also seen with catabolic drugs (e.g., steroids), GI/soft tissue bleeding (due to RBC digestion and re-absorption of urea), and dietary protein intake. Elevated Cr is also seen with increased muscle breakdown and various drugs. The baseline Cr level varies proportionately with muscle mass. Prognosis More than 80% of patients in whom AKI develops recover completely. However, prognosis varies widely depending on the severity of renal failure and other comorbidities. The older the patient and the more severe the insult, the lower is the likelihood of complete recovery. The most common cause of death is infection (75% of all deaths), followed by cardiorespiratory complications. Other nonfatal complications include chronic kidney injury and need for dialysis Life-threatening consequences volume overload hypoerkalaemia metabolic acidosis Risk factors: Diabetes, HTN, Elderly Approach Prerenal failure a. Most common cause of AKI; potentially reversible b. Etiology (decrease in systemic arterial blood volume or renal perfusion leading to renal ischemia)\u2014can complicate any disease that causes hypovolemia, low cardiac output, or systemic vasodilation Hypovolemia\u2014dehydration, excessive diuretic use, poor fluid intake, vomiting, diarrhea, burns, hemorrhage, CHF, cardiorenal syndrome Hypotension (systolic BP below 90 mm Hg), from sepsis, excessive, antihypertensive medications, bleeding, dehydration Renal arterial obstruction (kidney is hypoperfused despite elevated blood pressure) Cirrhosis, hepatorenal syndrome In patients with decreased renal perfusion, NSAIDs (constrict afferent arteriole), ACE inhibitors (cause efferent arteriole vasodilation), and cyclosporin can precipitate prerenal failure. Pathophysiology Renal blood flow decreases enough to lower the GFR, which leads to decreased clearance of metabolites (BUN, Cr, uremic toxins). Because the renal parenchyma is undamaged, tubular function (and therefore the concentrating ability) is preserved. Therefore, the kidney responds appropriately, conserving as much sodium and water as possible. This form of AKI is reversible on restoration of blood flow; but if hypoperfusion persists, ischemia results and can lead to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) Clinical features signs of volume depletion (dry mucous membranes, hypotension, tachycardia, decreased tissue turgor, oliguria/anuria) Diagnosis and Investigations Oliguria\u2014always found in prerenal failure (this is to preserve volume) Increased BUN-to-serum Cr ratio (>20:1 is the classic ratio)\u2014because kidney can reabsorb urea to increase sodium and water retention Increased urine osmolality (>500 mOsm/kg H2O)\u2014because the kidney is able to appropriately reabsorb water Decreased urine Na+ (<20 mEq/L with fractional excretion of sodium [FENa] <1%) because Na+ is avidly reabsorbed Increased urine\u2013plasma Cr ratio (>40:1)\u2014because much of the filtrate is reabsorbed (but not the creatinine) Bland urine sediment, indicating lack of significant cellular damage to glomeruli or tubules Intrinsic renal failure a. Kidney tissue (interstitium, glomeruli, tubules) is damaged such that glomerular filtration and tubular function are significantly impaired. Thus, kidneys are unable to concentrate urine effectively. b. Causes Tubular disease (ATN)\u2014can be caused by ischemia (most common cause), nephrotoxins (see Clinical Pearls 7-3 and 7-4) Glomerular disease (acute glomerulonephritis [GN])\u2014for example, Goodpasture syndrome, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, poststreptococcal GN, lupus Vascular disease\u2014for example, renal artery occlusion, TTP, HUS Interstitial disease\u2014for example, allergic interstitial nephritis, often due to a hypersensitivity reaction to medication c. Clinical features depend on the cause. Edema is usually present. Recovery may be possible but takes longer than in prerenal failure. d. Laboratory findings Decreased BUN-to-serum Cr ratio (<20:1, typically closer to 10:1 ratio) in comparison with prerenal failure. Both BUN and Cr levels are still elevated, but less urea is reabsorbed than in prerenal failure as kidney is no longer actively reabsorbing it. Increased urine Na+ (>40 mEq/L with FENa > 2% to 3%)\u2014because Na+ is poorly reabsorbed Decreased urine osmolality (<350 mOsm/kg H2O)\u2014because renal water reabsorption is impaired Decreased urine\u2013plasma Cr ratio (<20:1)\u2014because filtrate cannot be reabsorbed Postrenal failure a. Least common cause of AKI b. Obstruction of any segment of the urinary tract (with intact kidney) causes increased tubular pressure (urine produced cannot be excreted), which leads to decreased GFR. Blood supply and renal parenchyma are intact. Note that both kidneys must be obstructed (e.g., prostatic enlargement) for creatinine to rise. c. Renal function is restored if obstruction is relieved before the kidneys are damaged. d. Postrenal obstruction, if untreated, can lead to ATN. e. Causes Urethral obstruction secondary to enlarged prostate (BPH) is the most common cause Obstruction of solitary kidney Nephrolithiasis Obstructing neoplasm (bladder, cervix, prostate, and so on) Retroperitoneal fibrosis Ureteral obstruction is an uncommon cause because obstruction must be bilateral to cause renal failure. Diagnosis Blood tests EUC, FBC, LFT, Coags, ESR, CRP, CK Unclear cause - consider GMs Serum IG, electrophoresis, C3/C4, ASOT, Autoantibodies (ANA, ANCA, anti-dsDNA, anti-GBM) a. Elevation in BUN and Cr levels. Be aware that small changes in Cr may reflect a much more significant decrease in GFR. b. Electrolytes (retention of K+, PO4 3\u2212, drop in HCO3 \u2212 indicating acidosis, decrease in Na+ due to fluid retention) c. Albumin levels to monitor for nephrotic syndrome d. CBC with differential Urinalysis (Figure 7-2 and Table 7-2). a. A dipstick test positive for protein (3+, 4+) suggests intrinsic renal failure due to glomerular insult. b. Microscopic examination of the urine sediment: Crystals indicate presence of stones. Micro-organisms are seen in both infection and nonpathogenic colonization (differentiation made based on symptoms). Granular casts degeneration of cells and protein aggregates seen in ATN (\u201cmuddy brown\u201d casts) Hyaline casts are devoid of contents (seen in prerenal failure). RBC casts indicate glomerular disease. WBC casts indicate renal parenchymal inflammation. Fatty casts indicate nephrotic syndrome. Urine chemistry\u2014to distinguish between different forms of AKI. a. Urine Na+, Cr, and osmolality: Urine Na+ depends on dietary intake. b. FENa: collect urine and plasma electrolytes simultaneously = [(UNa )/(PNa )/(UCr)/PCr) \u00d7 100], where U = urine and P = plasma. Values below 1% suggest prerenal failure. Values above 2% to 3% suggest ATN. FENa is most useful if oliguria is present. If patient is on diuretics, UNa will be artificially elevated and fractional excretion of urea (FEUrea) must be used instead. c. Renal failure index 5 (uNa/[uCr/pCr]) \u00d7 100) Values below 1% suggest prerenal failure. Values above 1% suggest ATN. Urine culture and sensitivities\u2014if infection is suspected. Renal ultrasound. a. Primarily useful for evaluating kidney size and for excluding urinary tract obstruction (i.e., postrenal failure)\u2014presence of bilateral hydronephrosis or hydroureter b. Order for most patients with AKI\u2014unless the cause of the AKI is obvious and is not postrenal CT scan (abdomen and pelvis)\u2014may be helpful in some cases; usually done if renal ultrasound shows an abnormality such as hydronephrosis Renal biopsy\u2014useful occasionally if there is suspicion of acute GN or acute allergic interstitial nephritis Renal arteriography\u2014to evaluate for possible renal artery occlusion; should be performed only if specific therapy will make a difference CXR - pulmonary oedema ECG - hyperkalaemic changes Complications ECF volume expansion and resulting pulmonary edema\u2014treat with a diuretic (furosemide) Metabolic a. Hyperkalemia\u2014due to decreased excretion of K+ and the movement of potassium from ICF to ECF due to tissue destruction and acidosis b. Metabolic acidosis (with increased anion gap)\u2014due to decreased excretion of hydrogen ions; if severe (below 16 mEq/L), correct with sodium bicarbonate c. Hypocalcemia\u2014loss of ability to form active vitamin D and rapid development of PTH resistance d. Hyponatremia may occur if water intake is greater than body losses, or if a volume-depleted patient consumes excessive hypotonic solutions. (Hypernatremia may also be seen in hypovolemic states.) e. Hyperphosphatemia\u2014due to decreased clearance f. Hyperuricemia Uremia\u2014toxic end products of metabolism accumulate (especially from protein metabolism), leading to such complications as: a. Platelet dysfunction b. Immune dysfunction c. Pericarditis d. Encephalopathy Infection a. A common and serious complication of AKI (occurs in 50% to 60% of cases). The cause is probably multifactorial, but uremia itself is thought to impair immune function. b. Examples include pneumonia, UTI, wound infection, and sepsis. Treatment General measures (see also Table 7-3). a. Avoid medications that decrease renal blood flow (NSAIDs) and/or that are nephrotoxic (e.g., aminoglycosides, radiocontrast agents). b. Adjust medication dosages for level of renal function. c. Correct fluid imbalance. If volume depleted, give IV fluids. However, many patients with AKI are volume overloaded (especially if they are oliguric or anuric), so diuresis may be necessary IF SYMPTOMATIC The goal is to strike a balance between correcting volume deficits and avoiding volume overload (while maintaining adequate urine output). Remember that urine output is a reflection of renal blood flow (volume status) and GFR (kidney function). Monitor fluid balance by daily weight measurements (most accurate estimate) and intake\u2013output records. Be sure to take into account the patient\u2019s cardiac history when considering treatment options for fluid imbalances (i.e., do not give excessive fluid to a patient with CHF). d. Correct electrolyte disturbances if present. e. Optimize cardiac output. BP should be approximately 120 to 140/80 to 90. f. Order dialysis if symptomatic uremia, intractable acidemia, hyperkalemia, or volume overload develop. Indications for urgent dialysis often remembered by \u201cAEIOU\u201d mnemonic: Acidosis, Electrolytes, Intoxications (such as in overdoses), volume Overload, Uremia. Prerenal a. Treat the underlying disorder (such as hypovolemic or cardiogenic shock). b. Give fluids to maintain euvolemia and restore blood pressure\u2014do not give to patients with edema or ascites. May be necessary to stop antihypertensive medications. Remember that NS is often preferred unless acidemia is present (may worsen with hyperchloremia), in which case LR can be used. c. Eliminate any offending agents (ACE inhibitors, NSAIDs). d. If patient is unstable, Swan\u2013Ganz monitoring for accurate assessment of intravascular volume. Intrinsic a. Once ATN develops, therapy is supportive and renal function generally recovers. Eliminate the cause/offending agent. b. If oliguric, a trial of furosemide may help to increase urine flow. This improves fluid balance. Postrenal\u2014a bladder catheter may be inserted to decompress the urinary tract. Consider urology consultation. a. Be aware of the potential for post-obstructive diuresis and a rapid increase in urine output when obstruction is resolved, which may require IV fluid replacement.","title":"Acute kidney injury (AKI)"},{"location":"IM/Nephrology/Acute%20Kidney%20Injury.html#acute-kidney-injury-aki","text":"","title":"Acute kidney injury (AKI)"},{"location":"IM/Nephrology/Acute%20Kidney%20Injury.html#background","text":"","title":"Background"},{"location":"IM/Nephrology/Acute%20Kidney%20Injury.html#definition","text":"A rapid decline in renal function over hours or days, with an increase in serum creatinine level while the cutoff for rise in creatinine which qualifies as an \u201cinjury\u201d is controversial, an increase of as little as 0.3 mg/dL may have clinical relevance, while traditional definitions describe a relative increase of 50% or an absolute increase of 0.5 to 1.0 mg/dL).

General goals of therapy are reversing the initial insult to the kidney and/or supportive care as GFR recovers, as well as preventing fulminant kidney failure requiring temporary or permanent hemodialysis. Weight gain and edema are most common findings in patients with AKI. This is due to a positive water and sodium (Na+) balance. Characterized by azotemia (elevated BUN and Cr) Elevated BUN is also seen with catabolic drugs (e.g., steroids), GI/soft tissue bleeding (due to RBC digestion and re-absorption of urea), and dietary protein intake.

Correct fluid imbalance. If volume depleted, give IV fluids. However, many patients with AKI are volume overloaded (especially if they are oliguric or anuric), so diuresis may be necessary IF SYMPTOMATIC The goal is to strike a balance between correcting volume deficits and avoiding volume overload (while maintaining adequate urine output). Remember that urine output is a reflection of renal blood flow (volume status) and GFR (kidney function). Monitor fluid balance by daily weight measurements (most accurate estimate) and intake\u2013output records. Be sure to take into account the patient\u2019s cardiac history when considering treatment options for fluid imbalances (i.e., do not give excessive fluid to a patient with CHF). d. Correct electrolyte disturbances if present. e. Optimize cardiac output. BP should be approximately 120 to 140/80 to 90. f.

General Characteristics 1. Overview a. Dialysis is the artificial mechanism by which fluid and toxic solutes are removed from the circulation when the kidneys cannot do so sufficiently. b. In all forms of dialysis, the blood interfaces with an artificial solution resembling human plasma (called the dialysate), and diffusion of fluid and solutes occurs across a semipermeable membrane. c. The two major methods of dialyzing a patient are hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis (discussed below). d. The majority of dialysis patients in the United States receive hemodialysis at hospitals or dialysis centers, but more and more patients are opting for chronic ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). e. For patients with life-threatening complications of AKI, continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) can be used for constant renal support. This also avoids the larger fluid shifts of intermittent hemodialysis which hemodynamically unstable or heart failure patients may not be able to handle. B. When to Initiate Dialysis 1. General settings in which dialysis is considered. a. CKD\u2014dialysis serves as a bridge to renal transplantation or as a permanent treatment when the patient is not a transplantation candidate. b. AKI\u2014dialysis is often required as a temporary measure until the patient\u2019s renal function improves, often due to absolute indications (see Quick Hit). c. Overdose of medications or ingestions of substances cleared by the kidneys\u2014 some, but not all medications and toxins can be dialyzed (see Quick Hit). 2. Nonemergent indications a. Note: Cr and BUN levels are not absolute indications for dialysis, however some nephrologists will decide to initiate dialysis once a CKD patient\u2019s GFR drops below a certain value. b. Symptoms of uremia Nausea and vomiting Lethargy/deterioration in mental status, encephalopathy, seizures Pericarditis Emergent indications (usually in the setting of renal failure) a. Life-threatening manifestations of volume overload Pulmonary edema Hypertensive emergency refractory to antihypertensive agents b. Severe, refractory electrolyte disturbances, for example, hyperkalemia, hypermagnesemia c. Severe metabolic acidosis d. Drug toxicity/ingestions (particularly in patients with renal failure): methanol, ethylene glycol, lithium, aspirin C. Hemodialysis 1. Process a. The patient\u2019s blood is pumped by an artificial pump outside of the body through the dialyzer, which typically consists of fine capillary networks of semipermeable membranes. The dialysate flows on the outside of these networks, and fluid and solutes diffuse across the membrane. b. The patient\u2019s blood must be heparinized to prevent clotting in the dialyzer. 2. Frequency: Most hemodialysis patients require 3 to 5 hours of dialysis 3 days per week. 3. Access a. Use the central catheter placed using the Seldinger technique most often in the subclavian or jugular vein for temporary access. b. Tunneled catheters are placed under the skin which leads to a lower rate of infection. These catheters are often suitable for use up to 6 months. c. Arteriovenous fistula. Best form of permanent dialysis access. It requires vascular surgery to connect the radial or brachial artery to veins in the forearm. An audible bruit and palpable thrill (due to high flow) over the fistula indicates that it is patent. Absence of these findings is abnormal and is concerning for thrombosis of the vessel. d. An alternative to an arteriovenous fistula is an implantable graft\u2014typically made of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE). 4. Alternatives to traditional hemodialysis. a. Continuous arteriovenous hemodialysis (CAVHD) and continuous venovenous hemodialysis (CVVHD) are often used in hemodynamically unstable patients, such as ICU patients with AKI. This allows for closer control of electrolytes and fluid status. b. Lower flow rates of blood and dialysate enable dialysis to occur while minimizing rapid shifts in volume and osmolality which these patients may not be able to tolerate. c. They require highly efficient dialyzers to be effective. 5. Advantages of hemodialysis. a. It is more efficient than peritoneal dialysis. High flow rates and efficient dialyzers shorten the period of time required for dialysis. b. It can be initiated more quickly than peritoneal dialysis, using temporary vascular access in the emergent setting. 6. Disadvantages of hemodialysis. a. It is less similar to the physiology of natural kidney function than is peritoneal dialysis, predisposing the patient to the following: Hypotension due to rapid removal of intravascular volume leading to rapid fluid shifts from the extravascular space into cells. Hypo-osmolality due to solute removal. b. Requires vascular access. D. Peritoneal Dialysis 1. Process a. The peritoneum serves as the dialysis membrane. Dialysate fluid is infused into the peritoneal cavity, then fluids and solutes from the peritoneal capillaries diffuse into the dialysate fluid, which is drained from the abdomen. b. A hyperosmolar (high-glucose) solution is used, and water is removed from the blood via osmosis. 2. Frequency: dialysate fluid is drained and replaced every hour in acute peritoneal dialysis, but only once every 4 to 8 hours in CAPD. 3. Access a. With CAPD, dialysate is infused into the peritoneal fluid via an implanted catheter. b. A temporary catheter is used for acute peritoneal dialysis. 4. Advantages a. The patient can learn to perform dialysis on his or her own. b. It mimics the physiology of normal kidney function more closely than hemodialysis in that it is more continuous. 5. Disadvantages a. High glucose load may lead to hyperglycemia and hypertriglyceridemia. b. Peritonitis is a significant potential complication. c. The patients must be highly motivated to self-administer it. d. Cosmetic\u2014there is increased abdominal girth due to dialysate fluid. E. Limitations and Complications of Dialysis 1. Limitations\u2014dialysis does not replicate the kidney\u2019s synthetic functions. Therefore, dialysis patients are still prone to erythropoietin and vitamin D deficiency, with their associated complications. 2. Complications associated with hemodialysis. a. Hypotension\u2014may result in myocardial ischemia, fatigue, and so on. b. The relative hypo-osmolality of the ECF compared with the brain may result in nausea, vomiting, headache, and rarely, seizures or coma. c. \u201cFirst-use syndrome\u201d\u2014chest pain, back pain, and rarely, anaphylaxis may occur immediately after a patient uses a new dialysis machine. d. Hemolysis: often due to issues with dialysate solution e. Complications associated with anticoagulation\u2014hemorrhage, hematoma, etc. f. Infection of vascular access site\u2014may lead to sepsis. g. Hemodialysis-associated amyloidosis of \u03b22 -microglobulin in bones and joints, can lead to bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome. 3. Complications associated with peritoneal dialysis. a. Peritonitis, often accompanied by fever and abdominal pain\u2014usually can be treated with intraperitoneal antibiotics; cloudy peritoneal fluid is key sign. b. Abdominal/inguinal hernia\u2014increased risk due to elevated intra-abdominal pressures. c. Hyperglycemia\u2014especially with diabetic patients. d. Protein malnutrition.","title":"Dialysis"},{"location":"IM/Nephrology/Dialysis%20in%20Renal%20Failure.html#dialysis","text":"","title":"Dialysis"},{"location":"IM/Nephrology/Dialysis%20in%20Renal%20Failure.html#background","text":"There are three main forms of dialysis: Haemodialysis (HD) Haemofiltration Peritoneal dialysis (PD)","title":"Background"},{"location":"IM/Nephrology/Dialysis%20in%20Renal%20Failure.html#how-to-choose-dialysis","text":"Independent patients \u2192 allow maintained independence \u2192 peritoneal dialysis If potential issues with peritoneum or bowel, or high risk infection \u2192 haemodialysis If not independent \u2192 haemodialysis","title":"How to choose dialysis"},{"location":"IM/Nephrology/Dialysis%20in%20Renal%20Failure.html#indications-for-dialysis","text":"Acidosis Electrolyte abnormalities Intoxication Overload (fluid) Uremia A. General Characteristics 1. Overview a. Dialysis is the artificial mechanism by which fluid and toxic solutes are removed from the circulation when the kidneys cannot do so sufficiently. b. In all forms of dialysis, the blood interfaces with an artificial solution resembling human plasma (called the dialysate), and diffusion of fluid and solutes occurs across a semipermeable membrane. c. The two major methods of dialyzing a patient are hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis (discussed below). d. The majority of dialysis patients in the United States receive hemodialysis at hospitals or dialysis centers, but more and more patients are opting for chronic ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). e. For patients with life-threatening complications of AKI, continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) can be used for constant renal support. This also avoids the larger fluid shifts of intermittent hemodialysis which hemodynamically unstable or heart failure patients may not be able to handle. B. When to Initiate Dialysis 1. General settings in which dialysis is considered. a. CKD\u2014dialysis serves as a bridge to renal transplantation or as a permanent treatment when the patient is not a transplantation candidate. b. AKI\u2014dialysis is often required as a temporary measure until the patient\u2019s renal function improves, often due to absolute indications (see Quick Hit). c. Overdose of medications or ingestions of substances cleared by the kidneys\u2014 some, but not all medications and toxins can be dialyzed (see Quick Hit). 2. Nonemergent indications a. Note: Cr and BUN levels are not absolute indications for dialysis, however some nephrologists will decide to initiate dialysis once a CKD patient\u2019s GFR drops below a certain value. b. Symptoms of uremia Nausea and vomiting Lethargy/deterioration in mental status, encephalopathy, seizures Pericarditis Emergent indications (usually in the setting of renal failure) a. Life-threatening manifestations of volume overload Pulmonary edema Hypertensive emergency refractory to antihypertensive agents b. Severe, refractory electrolyte disturbances, for example, hyperkalemia, hypermagnesemia c. Severe metabolic acidosis d. Drug toxicity/ingestions (particularly in patients with renal failure): methanol, ethylene glycol, lithium, aspirin C. Hemodialysis 1. Process a.

After several hours of dwell time, the dialysis solution is then drained, removing the waste products from the body, and exchanged for new dialysis solution.

Early diagnosis is difficult in the young child (under 5 years) and in developmentally delayed children; many of these children have established peritonitis or an appendix abscess at presentation. Delays in the diagnosis of acute appendicitis in childhood is related in part to its variable symptomatology. For example, there may be relatively little abdominal pain, vomiting may be absent and diarrhoea may be a misleading feature. Nevertheless, the most important and consistent feature is localized abdominal pain. The pain may be intermittent and colicky initially, or situated in the epigastrium or periumbilical region, but soon shifts to the right iliac fossa. Constant pain that is worse with movement is the result of peritoneal irritation (\u2018peritonism\u2019). Vomiting occurs in the majority of children, and some may pass a loose stool. The temperature is usually normal or slightly raised, but occasionally may be in excess of 38 \u00b0C. Physical examination of the abdomen should be directed at showing that movement of adjacent peritoneal surfaces exacerbates the pain. The child's cooperation makes assessment easier, and repeated examination of the abdomen may be required to make the diagnosis. A child with appendicitis usually will exhibit tenderness and guarding localized to the right iliac fossa. Gentle palpation and percussion tenderness, performed while observing the child's face, will provide the most reliable evidence of abdominal tenderness and involuntary guarding. Rebound tenderness is an unreliable sign in children, and attempts to elicit the sign may cause unnecessary pain and destroy the child's confidence in the doctor. Rectal examination is required rarely and is primarily indicated if a pelvic appendix or pelvic collection is suspected. It should not be performed when examination of the ventral abdominal wall has already enabled a confident diagnosis of acute appendicitis to be made. Bowel sounds may be normal or reduced and contribute little to the diagnosis. Peritonitis should be suspected when the child is acutely ill with abdominal pain and fever and is reluctant to move. On examination, there will be generalized abdominal tenderness and guarding. Clinical example Mark, a 10-year-old boy, had 36 hours of constant lower abdominal pain, which steadily became more severe. He vomited once initially, and was \u2018off his food\u2019. Movement made the pain worse. On examination, he was afebrile but appeared flushed. He was tender to gentle palpation in the right iliac fossa and had percussion tenderness in the same region. The urine contained a few white and red cells but no bacteria. No other investigation was performed. At laparoscopy an acutely inflamed appendix was removed.","title":"Appendicitis (Paediatrics)"},{"location":"IM/Paediatric%20Medicine/GIT/Appendicitis%20%28Paediatrics%29.html#general-features","text":"Most common cause of abdominal pain in children Age \u2013 median 8-9yrs : pain before vomiting and fever is uncommon \u2013 beware preschool child and fit teenager 50% <5 will present with advanced \u2013 perforated/mass Acute onset abdo pain Infection/faecolith \u2192 Transmural inflammation \u2192perforation","title":"General features"},{"location":"IM/Paediatric%20Medicine/GIT/Appendicitis%20%28Paediatrics%29.html#clinical-features","text":"Intermittent periumbilical pain (appendicular midgut colic) - 24h \u2192 migrates to RIF - 36-48h (peritonieal inflammation) Fevers (not high grade) anorexia Pain changing over 12 hours of onset initially no-few vomiting 48h - risk of perforation","title":"Clinical features"},{"location":"IM/Paediatric%20Medicine/GIT/Appendicitis%20%28Paediatrics%29.html#clinical-approach","text":"Take good family history and medications history Inspection Position of child in bed, lying still with hips and knees flexed?

It can occur at any age but is most likely in the infant between 3 and 18 months who suddenly develops screaming attacks of pain with vomiting. During each episode of pain the infant becomes pale and may draw up the legs. The spasms of pain tend to last for 2\u20133 minutes and occur at intervals of about 10\u201320 minutes, although after a while the pain becomes more persistent. Vomiting is an early symptom. The passage of a few loose stools early on represents evacuation of the bowel distal to the obstruction. The small volume and limited duration of loose stools in intussusception helps differentiate it from acute gastroenteritis. Congestion of the intussusceptum may lead to the passage of blood-stained or \u2018redcurrant jelly\u2019 stools. Many infants with intussusception present with little more than pallor, lethargy and vomiting, and may have little evidence of abdominal pain. Should these symptoms be ignored, the infant may progress to develop signs of septicaemia or shock. The infant with intussusception looks pale, lethargic, anxious and unwell. A vague mass may be felt in the right or left upper quadrants of the abdomen but, once abdominal distension has developed, the mass becomes obscure and difficult to palpate. The apex of the intussusceptum may be palpable on rectal examination in a few, and the examining glove may be blood-stained. A plain X-ray of the abdomen will often be normal but may show an unusual bowel gas distribution or features of bowel obstruction. Ultrasound examination may be helpful in making the diagnosis. Where intussusception is suspected clinically or confirmed on ultrasonography, a gas or barium enema must be performed (unless the child has peritonitis). The enema will demonstrate the position of the apex of the intussusception . General features Age: 6-9Mo; uncommon <3mo or >6y Aetiology: 75% idiopathic, 20% post-viral Pathogenesis Invagination of proximal small bowel into distal segment (peristalsis) \u2192 trapping \u2192 ischaemia \u2192 sloughing of mucosa \u2192 mucus and bleeding (red currant jelly) 10% associated with lead point (= a piece of intestinal tissue which protrudes into the bowel lumen) ?Rotavirus, ?Infection as other causative agents 2-8% pathological lead point (intestinal tissue which protrudes into the bowel lumen) e.g. Meckel\u2019s diverticulum, lymphoma, duplication cyst Peutz-Jeghers syndrome \u2013 lip pigmentation - polyps Typically occurs in the ileo-caelcal valve (75-95%) due to abundance of lymphoid tissue (lead points) ileoileocolic is second most common, whereas ileoileal, colocolic and gastric are uncommon Almost all intussusceptions occur with the intussusceptum having been located proximally to the intussuscipiens - due to peristaltic action of intestine pulling proximal segment INTO distal segment Clinical features Classical triad in 15%: otherwise inconsolable, pallor, lethargy after pain subsides crampy (intermittent, colicky) abdominal pain \u2013 drawing legs up vomiting ( initially non bile stained ), and bloody stools (red currant jelly late sign) due to compression of bowel may feel abdominal mass in epigastrium or RUQ Ileocolic in 95% (ileum \u2192 caecum) - abundance of lymphoid tissue related to the terminal ileum, most are idiopathic Ileoileum \u2013 small bowel into small bowel \u2013 does not require surgical intervention unless >2cm and evidence of SBO Examination Exam early little abdo mass may be tender due to ischaemia DRE may reveal PR bleeding (not in nappy or noted by mum) Investigations AXR - mass, lack of gas, fluid levels=obstruction, ?free intraperitoneal gas \u2013 50% yield GS imaging: Abdo US \u2013 rule out pyelonephritis Target sign (3cm)/doughnut sign : concentric alternating echogenic (mucosa/muscularis) and hypoechogenic (submucosa) bands . Pseudokidney sign: longitudinal US of the intussuscepted segment of bowel. The fat containing mesentery \u2192 intussusception, which contains vessels, resembles the renal hilum. The renal parenchyma is formed by the oedematous bowel crescent in a doughnut sign : transverse US appearance of intestinal intussusception. The crescent is formed by mesentery dragged into the intussusception. It is only on one side of the bowel \u2192 echogenic crescent Management (not usually immediately life-threatening) Resuscitation (bolus, maintenance, replacement) Pain relief no role for ABx if no signs of ischemia, peritonitis, infection \u2013 risk of gram negative sepsis Mx: Non-operative Air enema reduction 85% successful . Long history and presence of a lead point less successful. Confirmed if reflux of air into small bowel . foley catheter placed into bottom and buttocks strapped, air pressure is delivered to 80mmHg - air enters, and reduces the colon until it reaches the distal small bowel; until reflux of air into small bowel, the procedure is NOT successful. Failure requires surgery. Recurrence of 5% within 24h within 30% of patients Give 3 min \u2013 if has not moved \u2192 theatre CI if perforation \u2013 1% risk Surgery: When enema fails - abdomen is opened and part telescoped in is squeezed out (rather than pulled out \u2013 risk of tearing the bowel) manually \u2013 otherwise resected Perforation Sick child Failed reduction Intussusception can be reduced non-operatively by gas enema or by hydrostatic reduction under ultrasonographic control: these techniques are successful in 80\u201390% of patients. If gas enema facilities are not available, a barium enema under continuous fluoroscopic control is a less effective but satisfactory alternative. Peritonitis and septicaemia, which suggest the presence of dead bowel, are the only contraindications to attempted enema reduction. A dehydrated child should have intravenous fluid resuscitation and be wrapped in warm blankets before commencing an enema reduction. The success of enema reduction is recognized when there is sudden or rapid flow of gas or barium into the ileum. If partial reduction is achieved, and the child remains in good clinical condition, a further enema should be attempted after several hours (so called \u2018delayed repeat enema\u2019), and in about half of these patients it will be successful. Recurrence of intussusception occurs in about 9% of children after enema reduction, usually within days. Surgery is reserved for: those in whom enema reduction has failed those who have clinical evidence of necrotic bowel, such as peritonitis and septicaemia those in whom there is evidence of pathological lesions at the lead point. Prognosis Recurrence 10% - about 5% within 24 hours Clinical example Tim, a previously well 22-month-old infant, suddenly became unwell with onset of vomiting and a temperature of 38.5 \u00b0C. Within 12 hours he started passing frequent, loose motions. Associated with this he appeared to have bouts of abdominal pain. On the second day the vomiting stopped but the diarrhoea persisted at a rate of more than eight stools per day. On presentation to the emergency department, Tim's weight was 13.6 kg, compared with 14.5 kg 3 weeks previously. He was clinically assessed to be 5\u20138% dehydrated and was treated with an oral rehydration solution via a nasogastric tube. A provisional diagnosis of acute gastroenteritis was made. His temperature gradually settled over 24 hours and oral feeds were introduced once rehydration was complete. His stools returned to their normal pattern after 5 days. Rapid stool testing for rotavirus antigen was positive.","title":"Intussusception"},{"location":"IM/Paediatric%20Medicine/GIT/Intussusception.html#intussusception","text":"In intussusception, the distal ileum (the intussusceptum) telescopes into adjoining distal bowel (the intussuscipiens), resulting in intestinal obstruction.

A vague mass may be felt in the right or left upper quadrants of the abdomen but, once abdominal distension has developed, the mass becomes obscure and difficult to palpate. The apex of the intussusceptum may be palpable on rectal examination in a few, and the examining glove may be blood-stained. A plain X-ray of the abdomen will often be normal but may show an unusual bowel gas distribution or features of bowel obstruction. Ultrasound examination may be helpful in making the diagnosis. Where intussusception is suspected clinically or confirmed on ultrasonography, a gas or barium enema must be performed (unless the child has peritonitis). The enema will demonstrate the position of the apex of the intussusception .","title":"Intussusception"},{"location":"IM/Paediatric%20Medicine/GIT/Intussusception.html#general-features","text":"Age: 6-9Mo; uncommon <3mo or >6y Aetiology: 75% idiopathic, 20% post-viral","title":"General features"},{"location":"IM/Paediatric%20Medicine/GIT/Intussusception.html#pathogenesis","text":"Invagination of proximal small bowel into distal segment (peristalsis) \u2192 trapping \u2192 ischaemia \u2192 sloughing of mucosa \u2192 mucus and bleeding (red currant jelly) 10% associated with lead point (= a piece of intestinal tissue which protrudes into the bowel lumen) ?Rotavirus, ?Infection as other causative agents 2-8% pathological lead point (intestinal tissue which protrudes into the bowel lumen) e.g. Meckel\u2019s diverticulum, lymphoma, duplication cyst Peutz-Jeghers syndrome \u2013 lip pigmentation - polyps Typically occurs in the ileo-caelcal valve (75-95%) due to abundance of lymphoid tissue (lead points) ileoileocolic is second most common, whereas ileoileal, colocolic and gastric are uncommon Almost all intussusceptions occur with the intussusceptum having been located proximally to the intussuscipiens - due to peristaltic action of intestine pulling proximal segment INTO distal segment","title":"Pathogenesis"},{"location":"IM/Paediatric%20Medicine/GIT/Intussusception.html#clinical-features","text":"Classical triad in 15%: otherwise inconsolable, pallor, lethargy after pain subsides crampy (intermittent, colicky) abdominal pain \u2013 drawing legs up vomiting ( initially non bile stained ), and bloody stools (red currant jelly late sign) due to compression of bowel may feel abdominal mass in epigastrium or RUQ Ileocolic in 95% (ileum \u2192 caecum) - abundance of lymphoid tissue related to the terminal ileum, most are idiopathic Ileoileum \u2013 small bowel into small bowel \u2013 does not require surgical intervention unless >2cm and evidence of SBO","title":"Clinical features"},{"location":"IM/Paediatric%20Medicine/GIT/Intussusception.html#examination","text":"Exam early little abdo mass may be tender due to ischaemia DRE may reveal PR bleeding (not in nappy or noted by mum)","title":"Examination"},{"location":"IM/Paediatric%20Medicine/GIT/Intussusception.html#investigations","text":"AXR - mass, lack of gas, fluid levels=obstruction, ?free intraperitoneal gas \u2013 50% yield GS imaging: Abdo US \u2013 rule out pyelonephritis Target sign (3cm)/doughnut sign : concentric alternating echogenic (mucosa/muscularis) and hypoechogenic (submucosa) bands .

The vast majority of pediatric patients with SBS have undergone neonatal surgical resection of intestine. The most common etiologies in children are necrotizing enterocolitis (45%); intestinal atresias (23%); gastroschisis Hay_Ch21_p0626-0668.indd 638 20/03/18 12:07 PM GASTROINTESTINAL TRACT 639 (15%); volvulus (15%); and, less commonly, congenital short bowel, long-segment Hirschsprung disease, and ischemic bowel. In many instances, infants with SBS require PN in order to provide adequate caloric, fluid, and electrolyte delivery in the setting of insufficient intestinal absorptive function. The requirement of supplemental PN for more than 2\u20133 months in the setting of SBS or any other underlying disorder qualifies the diagnosis of intestinal failure (IF). The goal in management of the patient with SBS is to promote growth and adaptation of the intestine such that adequate nutrition can be delivered and absorbed enterally. Many factors, including patient\u2019s gestational age, postsurgical anatomy (including residual small bowel length and presence of ileocecal valve and/or colon), presence of small bowel bacterial overgrowth, and underlying surgical disease, influence the process and likelihood of bowel adaptation and achievement of enteral autonomy. No specific anatomic bowel length measurements offer 100% certainty in predicting clinical outcomes in SBS. \u00bb Symptoms & Signs Typical symptoms for the patient with SBS are related to their underlying malabsorptive state, including diarrhea, dehydration, electrolyte or micronutrient deficiency states, and growth failure. Patients with SBS are also at risk for small bowel obstruction, bowel dilation and dysmotility (with secondary small bowel bacterial overgrowth), hepatobiliary disorders including cholelithiasis, nephrolithiasis due to calcium oxalate stones, oral feeding challenges, and GI mucosal inflammatory problems including noninfectious colitis and anastomotic ulcerations. For patients with IF, complications related to underlying PN therapy are common and can be life threatening. PN-associated liver disease (PNALD) is a progressive cholestatic liver injury that occurs in pediatric patients on PN and may progress to end-stage liver disease in 10% of affected patients. Recurrent catheterrelated bloodstream infections are relatively common in pediatric patients with SBS and IF. Other complicationrelated central venous catheters including occlusions may require intervention. \u00bb Treatment & Prognosis Goal in management of SBS is to promote growth and adaptation while minimizing and/or treating complications of the underlying intestinal disorder or PN therapy. Intestinal rehabilitation for the child with SBS and IF refers to the multidisciplinary team approach to individual patient care, involving gastroenterology, nutrition, and surgery, and has been shown to improve outcomes. Enteral nutrition should be catered to favor absorption, commonly requiring continuous delivery of an elemental formula through a gastrostomy tube. Commonly prescribed pharmacologic adjuncts include acid suppressive therapy, antimotility and antidiarrheal agents, and antibiotics for the treatment of small bowel bacterial overgrowth. Emerging therapies targeted to promote bowel adaptation include glucagon-like peptide 2 analogues, which show promise in potentially increasing absorption and bowel adaptation in ongoing trials. Management for the patient with SBS and IF should include strategies to manage or prevent complications related to PN therapy, including infection and liver disease. Antimicrobial lock solutions distilled into central venous catheters using either ethanol or antibiotics may have a role in reducing infection rates.

The vast majority of pediatric patients with SBS have undergone neonatal surgical resection of intestine. The most common etiologies in children are necrotizing enterocolitis (45%); intestinal atresias (23%); gastroschisis Hay_Ch21_p0626-0668.indd 638 20/03/18 12:07 PM GASTROINTESTINAL TRACT 639 (15%); volvulus (15%); and, less commonly, congenital short bowel, long-segment Hirschsprung disease, and ischemic bowel. In many instances, infants with SBS require PN in order to provide adequate caloric, fluid, and electrolyte delivery in the setting of insufficient intestinal absorptive function. The requirement of supplemental PN for more than 2\u20133 months in the setting of SBS or any other underlying disorder qualifies the diagnosis of intestinal failure (IF). The goal in management of the patient with SBS is to promote growth and adaptation of the intestine such that adequate nutrition can be delivered and absorbed enterally. Many factors, including patient\u2019s gestational age, postsurgical anatomy (including residual small bowel length and presence of ileocecal valve and/or colon), presence of small bowel bacterial overgrowth, and underlying surgical disease, influence the process and likelihood of bowel adaptation and achievement of enteral autonomy. No specific anatomic bowel length measurements offer 100% certainty in predicting clinical outcomes in SBS. \u00bb Symptoms & Signs Typical symptoms for the patient with SBS are related to their underlying malabsorptive state, including diarrhea, dehydration, electrolyte or micronutrient deficiency states, and growth failure. Patients with SBS are also at risk for small bowel obstruction, bowel dilation and dysmotility (with secondary small bowel bacterial overgrowth), hepatobiliary disorders including cholelithiasis, nephrolithiasis due to calcium oxalate stones, oral feeding challenges, and GI mucosal inflammatory problems including noninfectious colitis and anastomotic ulcerations. For patients with IF, complications related to underlying PN therapy are common and can be life threatening. PN-associated liver disease (PNALD) is a progressive cholestatic liver injury that occurs in pediatric patients on PN and may progress to end-stage liver disease in 10% of affected patients. Recurrent catheterrelated bloodstream infections are relatively common in pediatric patients with SBS and IF. Other complicationrelated central venous catheters including occlusions may require intervention. \u00bb Treatment & Prognosis Goal in management of SBS is to promote growth and adaptation while minimizing and/or treating complications of the underlying intestinal disorder or PN therapy. Intestinal rehabilitation for the child with SBS and IF refers to the multidisciplinary team approach to individual patient care, involving gastroenterology, nutrition, and surgery, and has been shown to improve outcomes. Enteral nutrition should be catered to favor absorption, commonly requiring continuous delivery of an elemental formula through a gastrostomy tube. Commonly prescribed pharmacologic adjuncts include acid suppressive therapy, antimotility and antidiarrheal agents, and antibiotics for the treatment of small bowel bacterial overgrowth. Emerging therapies targeted to promote bowel adaptation include glucagon-like peptide 2 analogues, which show promise in potentially increasing absorption and bowel adaptation in ongoing trials. Management for the patient with SBS and IF should include strategies to manage or prevent complications related to PN therapy, including infection and liver disease. Antimicrobial lock solutions distilled into central venous catheters using either ethanol or antibiotics may have a role in reducing infection rates. Compelling evidence over the past several years suggests that modification of parenteral lipid solution, either through reduction in dose of soy-based intralipid or replacement with a third-generation lipid solution (Omegaven or SMOF lipid), improves outcomes associated with PNALD in pediatric patients.

Food allergy Food allergy in childhood is common, affecting 6\u20138% of children aged <3y. The commonest food allergies in early childhood are milk and egg. One to 3% of young children have cow\u2019s milk allergy. In later childhood, allergies to peanuts and tree nuts predominate. Other common allergens are fish, shellfish, wheat, and soy. Food allergy versus food intolerance Food intolerance is a non-immunologically mediated adverse reaction to food. It includes: **** Enzyme deficiencies, e.g. lactase deficiency. **** Pharmacological, e.g. tachycardias in heavy tea/coffee drinkers due to caffeine. **** Sensitivity to vasoactive amines in food, causing localized reactions such as lip swelling, e.g. cured meats, cheeses, fish, ripe bananas, oranges, tomatoes, strawberries. **** Toxin-mediated, e.g. scrombroid poisoning (histamine from spoilt fish), food poisoning. **** Chemical effects (gustatory rhinitis with hot/spicy foods). **** Irritant reactions. **** Infectious syndromes, e.g. food poisoning or acute urticaria with viral illness. Taking a food allergy history Careful history taking is important in a diagnosis of allergic disease, because it helps to differentiate allergic from non-allergic reactions, to identify potential triggers, and to direct investigations. **** Presenting symptoms: focus on gut, skin, and respiratory systems to differentiate IgE from non-IgE-mediated reactions (see Table 13.1 ). **** Timing of the reaction from ingestion. **** Previous exposure to the allergen and severity of reactions. **** Detailed feeding history, including breastfed/bottle-fed; weaning; foods avoided and why. **** Exposure to other common allergens (see Table 13.2 ): if they are being consuming regularly, there is no need to test for those allergens. **** Whether the reaction was preceded by exercise, viral illness, or alcohol consumption (as these can lower the threshold for reaction). **** History of other atopic diseases, including infantile eczema, asthma, and allergic rhinitis. **** Family history of atopy.

Late arterial phase - 35-40 sec p.i. or 15-20 sec after bolustracking. Sometimes also called \"arterial phase\" or \"early venous portal phase\", because some enhancement of the portal vein can be seen. All structures that get their bloodsupply from the arteries will show optimal enhancement. Hepatic or late portal phase - 70-80 sec p.i. or 50-60 sec after bolustracking. Although hepatic phase is the most accurate term, most people use the term \"late portal phase\". In this phase the liver parenchyma enhances through bloodsupply by the portal vein and you should see already some enhancement of the hepatic veins. Nephrogenic phase - 100 sec p.i. or 80 sec after bolustracking. This is when all of the renal parenchyma including the medulla enhances. Only in this phase you will be able to detect small renal cell carcinomas. Delayed phase - 6-10 minutes p.i. or 6-10 minutes after bolustracking. Sometimes called \"wash out phase\" or \"equilibrium phase\". There is wash out of contrast in all abdominal structures except for fibrotic tissue, because fibrotic tissue has a poor late wash out and will become relatively dense compared to normal tissue. This is comparable to late enhancement of infarcted scar tissue in cardiac MRI. All liver tumors however get 100% of their blood supply from the hepatic artery. So a hypervascular tumor will be best seen in the late arterial phase. A hypovascular liver tumor however will enhance poorly in the late arterial phase, because it is hypovascular and the surrounding liver does also enhance poorly in that phase. This tumor is best seen when the surrounding tissue enhances, i.e. in the late portal (or hepatic) phase at 75-80 sec p.i.

fractures Extra-articular fracture \u2192 mechanicla reduction by correcting length, alignment, rotation angular malunion \u2192 abnormal joint forces \u2192 pain and secondary degenerative joint disease generally well suited to intramedullary fixation techniques Metaphyseal fractures AO A: extra-articular joint congruity not an issue mechanical alignment, length, rotation need to be considered less predictable with intramedullary nailing - therefore use plate and screws, or external fixation (or K-wires in smaller joints) consideration given to stable fixation to allow early joint movement and rehabilitation Intra-articular fractures AO B: Partial articular and AO C: Complete articular principle of treatment - anatomical reduction of articular surface, rigid stabilisation Aim: allow early joint movement, avoid degenerative joint disease Considerations: increased wound complications of open surgery, devitalised bone fragments, excessive bone exposure Osteoporotic intra-articular fractures - though anatomical reduction MAY be achieved, rigid fixation may cut out of soft bone - would consider using bone substitutes to fill bone voids and augment fixation stable fixation not possible - consider non-operative treatment and delayed joint replacement can also consider primary joint replacement AO C: Complete articular, where articular sruface has separated from metaphysis articular surface initially anatomically reduced with temporary K-wires or lag screws then articular block reattached to the shaft","title":"General advice on fracture

University Health Service. She has a new partner and they have decided to undergo a sexual health check before taking their relationship any further. She is requesting \u2018test me for everything\u2019 What is the first step in conducting a sexual health check? Take a sexual history to determine risk Sexual History Questions to Ask: I\u2019d like to ask you some questions about sex so we can decide what tests to do. Is that ok? When was the last time you had sex? 3 weeks ago Who have you been having sex with? My ex Have you had sex with anyone else? One other boyfriend, couple of hook ups in between How did you have sex (Vaginal sex/oral sex/anal sex) ? Vaginal and oral Did you use a condom? Couple of times no, one of the one night stands no In the last 3 months, how many sexual partners have you had? Just my ex Have you ever been diagnosed with (or thought you had) an STI? No way I\u2019d like to ask you about some other activities that could increase someone\u2019s risk of some sexually transmitted infections and blood-borne viruses, is that ok? Have any of your male partners ever had sex with men? Not that they told me! Have you had sex with other women? Nope Are you pregnant? No way! Implanon 3 months ago Have you ever been paid to have sex? No Have you ever had any tattoos? If yes, was that here or overseas? Small butterfly on my shoulder, in Armidale Have you ever injected drugs? No What else should be done for Emily? Has she had a cervical screening test, if so when? She has had HPV vaccination in school but has never had CST Does she need a pelvic examination? As she has had HPV vaccination, is under 25 and asymptomatic she does not need a pelvis examination at this time What STI(s) should she be screened for? Chlamydia screening is recommended for all sexually active people <30 years Consider Hepatitis B, HIV & Syphilis in low risk populations (recommend test if not low risk) Consider Gonorrhoea screening in at risk groups, may be asymptomatic What tests are required to screen for these STI? How do you instruct Emily in collecting the sample? In the absence of a pelvic examination a self collected vaginal swab has better sensitivity than a first pass urine. NAAT (Nuclear acid amplication test) is performed for both Chlamydia and Gonorrhoea Self testing Self testing for NAAT is acceptable, especially when patient is uncomfortable with clinician collection or limited consultation times PCR is very sensitive Only appropriate flr asymptomatic patients Procedure Show swab to patient Label tubes with details to avoid mishandling Moisten tip of swab with saline or sterile water Put all equipment in specimen bag and hand to patient Review collection process with patient, remind to put swab inside tube, seal tube and put sealed tube inside specimen bag Results How do you relay these results to Emily? What treatment is recommended? First line treatment is either: Doxycycline 100mg PO bd for 7 days OR Azithromycin 1g PO once Is anything further required? Advise no sexual contact for 7 days after treatment is administered. Advise no sex with partners from the last 6 months until the partners have been tested and treated if necessary. Contact tracing. Provide patient with factsheet. Notify the state/territory health department. Follow up It is now 5 months later and Emily returns to see you She is upset and appears to be in pain Emily reports that she has been going out with her current boyfriend over the last 3 months. They started having regular sex about 2 months ago, after she was cleared from reinfection of Chlamydia Over the last 2 days she has developed a burning itch over her vulva. She has some stinging when she passes urine and feels generally unwell. Is there anything further you would like to know? Blisters and sores began to appear yesterday, very painful with a burning, stinging Never had these before Had sex about a week ago, Mark (boyfriend) was well, she didn\u2019t notice any sores or spots on his penis What are your differential diagnoses? Genital Ulcers are most commonly secondary to herpes infection (HSV-1 or HSV-2) Differential STI include Syphilis (not usually painful), lymphogranuloma venerum and donovanosis Non infectious causes include drug eruptions, aphthous ulcers, trauma, carcinoma Examination On Examination: Abdomen soft and not tender Tender inguinal lymph nodes bilaterally ^ Image from STI atlas (www.stiatlas.org) You deroof one of the lesions and take a swab of the fluid Once she is dressed again you tell her that it is most likely genital herpes as the cause. Emily is upset with this news. How did she get this, Mark was fine when they had sex? Viral shedding can occur in the absence of symptoms or vesicles Genital herpes can be secondary to HSV-1 or HSV-2 What is the recommended treatment and what advice do you need to give Emily now? Valaciclovir 500mg PO bd for 5-10 days (may require longer in initial episode) Simple analgesia, saline baths, topical lignocaine may help for symptoms Condom use regardless of the presence or absence of symptoms with partners Case 2: JB Presenting medical complaint John Bloom is a 24 year old man who comes to see you for the first time. He is obviously embarrassed is requires some gentle prompting to tell you why he is here. He eventually tells you he has a \u2018spot\u2019 on the end of his penis that has grown over the last couple of weeks. Its not painful, but it isn\u2019t going away John is a \u2018FIFO Worker\u2019 at one of the mines in Queensland (Fly-In-Fly-Out). He works 4 weeks on 4 weeks off and lives in the single-persons quarters at the mine. He is single but admits to having \u2018a bit of a good time when is on his time off\u2019 He reports having sex with 2 different women during his last time off. He shrugs and says that he can\u2019t remember their names and hasn\u2019t had any contact with them since. On examination On examination: Lesion just proximal to the glans, on the dorsum of the penile shaft. No exudate on the lesion No discharge from the urethra is noted Mild bilateral inguinal lymphadenopathy ^ From UpToDate Consult You tell Jon that you think he may have Syphilis and you would like to start him on treatment. You send him for a blood tests: Syphilis Enzyme Immunoassay (EIA) then Rapid Plasma Reagin (RPR) test Treponema pallidum specific antibody test. What is the recommended treatment for Syphilis? Benzathine penicillin 1.8g IM once Are there any other tests you would recommend Jon have? One STI indicates risk for others, Jon should be tested for Chlamydia, Gonorrohea, and HIV If he has not had Hepatitis B vaccination he should be screened for HBV and offered the vaccination What else should you discuss with Jon? Syphilis is a notifiable disease and contact tracing needs to be performed Investigations Consult continued You give Jon 1.8g benzathine penicillin IM as a single dose You also recommend to Jon that he have testing for other STI. He doesn\u2019t initially think that this is necessary, but agrees to after further discussion. Jon tests positive to Chlamydia but negative to HIV, Hepatitis B and Gonorrhoea He tries to recall the names of the women he had intercourse with but can only remember their first names \u2013 Sally and Hannah. He says he will keep an eye out for them next time he goes out. You inform Jon his infection must be notified to the Public Health Unit. You reassure him that the notification is entirely confidential, but a legal necessity. There is an anonymous SMS service that can inform sexual partners of STI diagnoses and risk: https://letthemknow.org.au You discuss with Jon his current safe sex practices and review strategies for improving them. Case 3: CM Presenting complaint Casey is a 30 year old single woman who attends your clinic complaining of a sore throat. It has been painful for 3 days now and she is starting to lose her voice. She is concerned as it is affecting her ability to work. PMHx nil Medications: Oral Contraceptive PIll SHx: Non smoker Drinks alcohol 3-4 drinks on a Friday or Saturday night Works in a call centre Examination Afebrile Tender cervical lymphadenopathy bilaterally Enlarged tonsils with exudate bilaterally How would you treat Casey? You tell Casey that she most likely has a viral infection and it should get better in a couple of days. You write her a medical certificate, recommend paracetamol, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medication, fluids and rest and ask her to return in 3 days if she is no better. Casey returns a week later with the same symptoms. She looks tired and her voice is hoarse but she continues to be afebrile. Her oropharynx is unchanged As she has had a sore throat for 10 days you are concerned that she may have a streptococcal throat infection You take a swab of Casey\u2019s tonsils to confirm your suspicions You prescribe phenoxypenicillin and once again ask her to return if she does not improve Follow up 6 weeks pass and Casey returns The culture from the throat swab was negative for group A streptococcus She is essentially unchanged, the hoarse voice and lymphadenopathy remains Casey now discloses to you that although she does work in a call centre she also works as a sex worker part time. She is adamant that she always practices safe sex with a condom. Does this change the differential diagnoses? You are suspicious that her sore throat could be secondary to Neisseria gonorrhoea and decide to take a swab. You decide to commence treatment for N gonorrhoea You recall that there are difficulties with emerging resistance of Gonorrhoea and treat Casey with 500mg ceftriaxone IM and 1g azithromycin PO You also recommend to Casey that she have testing for other STI. Swab confirms Neisseria gonorrhoea that is sensitive to ceftriaxone. HIV, Syphilis, Chlamydia and Hepatitis B testing is negative Microbiology Intracellular Gram negative diplococci, suggestive of N gonorrhoea Contact tracing Casey discloses that there may have been occasions where she engaged with unprotected masturbation games with clients You ask Casey to provide a list of her clients over that 8 weeks so that they may be contacted and appropriate treatment commenced. http://www.sti.guidelines.org.au","title":"Sexual Health"},{"location":"Teaching/Newcastle/Module%2010%20-%20Sexual%20health.html#sexual-health","text":"","title":"Sexual Health"},{"location":"Teaching/Newcastle/Module%2010%20-%20Sexual%20health.html#case-1-es","text":"Emily is a 20 year old University student in Armidale who presents to the University Health Service.

There is also a thrombocytosis that may be reactive. \u2022What are the major causes of anaemia associated with these findings? \u2022Causes of microcytic hypochromic anaemia include: \u2022Iron deficiency \u2022Disorders of globin synthesis such as thalassaemia or another haemoglobinopathy \u2022Disorders of porphyrin or haem synthesis (sideroblastic anaemia which may be congenital or associated with lead poisoning) \u2022Anaemia of chronic disease may cause a microcytic hypochromic appearance \u2022Which of these causes is most likely given the FBE results and why? \u2022A microcytic hypochromic anaemia is most often due to iron deficiency in a patient such as Bao. His microcytosis is mild and is of an appropriate severity given the degree of anaemia. The presence of a more severe microcytosis with a lesser degree of anaemia may lead one to suspect thalassaemia. The thromboycytosis is a common finding in patients with iron deficiency and is reactive in nature. \u2022What further testing is indicated? \u2022Iron studies are indicated to assess for iron deficiency. The presence of thalassaemia trait cannot be ruled out without further testing or without assessing response to iron therapy if iron studies indicate an iron deficiency. \u2022Bao had iron studies, liver function tests and CRP performed. His LFTs and CRP were normal. Interpret the results of his iron studies. \u2022What are the most common causes of iron deficiency anaemia? \u2022Gastrointestinal bleeding is the most common cause in Bao\u2019s age group. The most common sites are: upper GIT- oesophageal ulceration, malignancy, haemorrhoids, colorectal neoplasia, diverticular disease, angiodysplasia, Meckel diverticulum, coeliac disease. \u2022History should focus on- GI blood loss or melaena, weight loss, alcohol use, reflux symptoms, family history of GI cancer. \u2022What further investigations are required for Bao? \u2022Regardless of clinical findings that point to a specific cause for iron loss, a patient requires upper and lower GP endoscopies to exclude GI causes for blood loss, particularly malignancy. Referral to a gastroenterologist for these procedures is indicated. Case 2 \u2022The patient has a marked macrocytic anaemia with reticulocytopenia, thrombocytopaenia and mild leucopaenia. Neutrophil hypersegmentation is associated with a number of aetiologies, the most common being megaloblastic anaemia. \u2022Clinically she has developed a peripheral neuropathy (loss of distal proprioception and vibration sense loss, loss of sense of light touch). \u2022What are the causes of this blood picture? \u2022Macrocytic anaemia is most commonly associated with folate or B12 deficiency (megaloblastic anaemia). Myelodysplasia is a cause of macrocytic anaemia and pancytopaenia seen in the older population. Macrocytic anaemia may also be seen in patients with excessive alcohol intake, liver disease or hypothyroidism. It is also a common finding in patients taking antimetabolite meds such as methotrexate, certain antibiotics and antiretrovirals. \u2022Neutrophil hypersegmentation accompanies megaloblastic anaemia and therefore may occur with folate or B12 deficiency or the drugs above. \u2022Macrocytosis is also a feature of the myelodysplastic syndromes. This may also be accompanied by neutropaenia or thrombocytopaenia. \u2022Marked macrocytosis (>130fL) as seen in Helen\u2019s case usually indicates B12 or folate deficiency \u2022This results from: inadequate intake, poor absorption, or excessive utilisation (particularly for folate) \u2022Animal products contain B12, whereas green vegetables contain folate \u2022B12 requires an adequate acid environment in the stomach as well as secretion of intrinsic factor and a function ileum for successful absorption. Folate is absorbed in the jejumum. Before treating folate deficiency it is important to exclude concomitant B12 deficiency \u2022What further tests are required? \u2022B12 and folate levels \u2022B12 ref ranges vary between labs, and with repeat samples therefore careful interpretation required \u2022Serum folate a measure of short term folate balance, Red cell folate may better reflect long term stores, however not as reproducible as serum folate. \u2022This patient has multiple potential causes for having a B12 deficiency. She may have gastritis from her excessive ETOH intake (which may be more than she is stating). She has been on a Proton Pump inhibitor for a long time, which can block B12 absorption. Her diet may be inadequate if she following an overly restrictive diet (such as vegan). \u2022Students should also consider pernicious anaemia but it is beyond the scope of this tutorial to go into the detail of pernicious anaemia. It is appropriate to check for intrinsic factor antibody if her B12 level is low as this is highly specific (ie virtually diagnostic) of pernicious anaemia, but has low sensitivity. Equivocal cases should be discussed with a gastroenterologist. \u2022Folate deficiency may be caused by poor dietary intake and alcoholism, coeliac disease or inflammatory bowel disease or the other causes previously mentioned on slide 19. Case 3 What differential diagnosis should you consider at this stage?

There is also a thrombocytosis that may be reactive. \u2022What are the major causes of anaemia associated with these findings? \u2022Causes of microcytic hypochromic anaemia include: \u2022Iron deficiency \u2022Disorders of globin synthesis such as thalassaemia or another haemoglobinopathy \u2022Disorders of porphyrin or haem synthesis (sideroblastic anaemia which may be congenital or associated with lead poisoning) \u2022Anaemia of chronic disease may cause a microcytic hypochromic appearance \u2022Which of these causes is most likely given the FBE results and why? \u2022A microcytic hypochromic anaemia is most often due to iron deficiency in a patient such as Bao. His microcytosis is mild and is of an appropriate severity given the degree of anaemia. The presence of a more severe microcytosis with a lesser degree of anaemia may lead one to suspect thalassaemia. The thromboycytosis is a common finding in patients with iron deficiency and is reactive in nature. \u2022What further testing is indicated? \u2022Iron studies are indicated to assess for iron deficiency. The presence of thalassaemia trait cannot be ruled out without further testing or without assessing response to iron therapy if iron studies indicate an iron deficiency. \u2022Bao had iron studies, liver function tests and CRP performed. His LFTs and CRP were normal. Interpret the results of his iron studies. \u2022What are the most common causes of iron deficiency anaemia? \u2022Gastrointestinal bleeding is the most common cause in Bao\u2019s age group. The most common sites are: upper GIT- oesophageal ulceration, malignancy, haemorrhoids, colorectal neoplasia, diverticular disease, angiodysplasia, Meckel diverticulum, coeliac disease. \u2022History should focus on- GI blood loss or melaena, weight loss, alcohol use, reflux symptoms, family history of GI cancer. \u2022What further investigations are required for Bao? \u2022Regardless of clinical findings that point to a specific cause for iron loss, a patient requires upper and lower GP endoscopies to exclude GI causes for blood loss, particularly malignancy. Referral to a gastroenterologist for these procedures is indicated.","title":"Case 1"},{"location":"Teaching/Newcastle/Module%2011%20-%20Iron%20studies.html#case-2","text":"\u2022The patient has a marked macrocytic anaemia with reticulocytopenia, thrombocytopaenia and mild leucopaenia. Neutrophil hypersegmentation is associated with a number of aetiologies, the most common being megaloblastic anaemia. \u2022Clinically she has developed a peripheral neuropathy (loss of distal proprioception and vibration sense loss, loss of sense of light touch). \u2022What are the causes of this blood picture? \u2022Macrocytic anaemia is most commonly associated with folate or B12 deficiency (megaloblastic anaemia). Myelodysplasia is a cause of macrocytic anaemia and pancytopaenia seen in the older population. Macrocytic anaemia may also be seen in patients with excessive alcohol intake, liver disease or hypothyroidism. It is also a common finding in patients taking antimetabolite meds such as methotrexate, certain antibiotics and antiretrovirals. \u2022Neutrophil hypersegmentation accompanies megaloblastic anaemia and therefore may occur with folate or B12 deficiency or the drugs above. \u2022Macrocytosis is also a feature of the myelodysplastic syndromes. This may also be accompanied by neutropaenia or thrombocytopaenia. \u2022Marked macrocytosis (>130fL) as seen in Helen\u2019s case usually indicates B12 or folate deficiency \u2022This results from: inadequate intake, poor absorption, or excessive utilisation (particularly for folate) \u2022Animal products contain B12, whereas green vegetables contain folate \u2022B12 requires an adequate acid environment in the stomach as well as secretion of intrinsic factor and a function ileum for successful absorption. Folate is absorbed in the jejumum. Before treating folate deficiency it is important to exclude concomitant B12 deficiency \u2022What further tests are required? \u2022B12 and folate levels \u2022B12 ref ranges vary between labs, and with repeat samples therefore careful interpretation required \u2022Serum folate a measure of short term folate balance, Red cell folate may better reflect long term stores, however not as reproducible as serum folate. \u2022This patient has multiple potential causes for having a B12 deficiency. She may have gastritis from her excessive ETOH intake (which may be more than she is stating). She has been on a Proton Pump inhibitor for a long time, which can block B12 absorption. Her diet may be inadequate if she following an overly restrictive diet (such as vegan). \u2022Students should also consider pernicious anaemia but it is beyond the scope of this tutorial to go into the detail of pernicious anaemia. It is appropriate to check for intrinsic factor antibody if her B12 level is low as this is highly specific (ie virtually diagnostic) of pernicious anaemia, but has low sensitivity. Equivocal cases should be discussed with a gastroenterologist. \u2022Folate deficiency may be caused by poor dietary intake and alcoholism, coeliac disease or inflammatory bowel disease or the other causes previously mentioned on slide 19.","title":"Case 2"},{"location":"Teaching/Newcastle/Module%2011%20-%20Iron%20studies.html#case-3","text":"What differential diagnosis should you consider at this stage?

If the indication has been to differentiate between the causes of hyperthyroidism, then the pattern of uptake will provide an indication of the diagnosis (eg. Graves disease, multinodular goitre, thryoiditis), which enables an understanding of the natural history and can guide treatment. If the indication for the test was assessment of a thyroid nodule when the patient has hyperthyroidism, and the nodule is functioning (or 'hot') then treatment of the hyperthyroidism is the most likely next step. If the nodule is not functioning (or 'cold') then further investigation, such as ultrasound and/or fine needle biopsy is recommended.","title":"Thyroid function test"},{"location":"Teaching/Newcastle/Module%206%20-%20Fatigue.html","text":"Case 2 Presenting complaint You are working as a GP registrar at a clinic in Taree.

She has been in Australia for 40 years and speaks English well. She previously worked as a teacher\u2019s aide in the local primary school. Maria lives with her son Joe and his wife in Wyoming and is usually independent with all her activities of daily living although Joe helps out with some more complicated financial transactions and has done so since his Dad passed away ten years ago. Maria\u2019s family bring her to the emergency department at Gosford Hospital as they were concerned to find that whilst having her morning cup of tea (around 8am) she appeared to develop some mild right facial weakness and they were having difficulty understanding what she was trying to say. She picked up her mug and promptly dropped it. Maria\u2019s family bring her to the emergency department at Gosford Hospital as they were concerned to find that whilst having her morning cup of tea (around 8am) she appeared to develop some mild right facial weakness and they were having difficulty understanding what she was trying to say. She picked up her mug and promptly dropped it. She was able to walk to the car so they brought her to the hospital ED themselves as they were only 5 minutes drive away. Questions (Part 1): Was it a smart idea to bring Maria into hospital by family car? What are the advantages of calling an ambulance? Manage deterioration Appropriate hospital BAT CALL - to call ahead so no delay on arrival How should she be triaged on arrival, what are the critical components of initial assessment? ABCDE Level of consciousness Airway security History When you ask they state that Maria seemed perfectly fine when she went to bed the night before and on first waking this morning. Importance of being OK first thing this am? We are now able to establish how long Maria has been off for This is important in determining the type of treatment she is eligible for She was not complaining of headache or feeling otherwise unwell. She has not had these type of symptoms previously and does not suffer from migraine. What are the primary differentials? Stroke/TIA, Migraine, epilepsy, hypoglycaemia Anything else in history which may be of importance? Rule out stroke mimics - migraine, epilepsy, hypoglycaemia Has she had similar symptoms in the past? Diabetes and blood sugars? Complains of headache (migraine) Known AF or risk factors for vascular disease? On anticoagulants (i.e. risk of haemorrhage)? However RECOGNISE that time is of the essence - a stroke call should be done by this point Past medical history Maria suffers from Type 2 diabetes mellitus She has well controlled hypertension and is overweight (BMI 28) She had a left total knee replacement two years ago without perioperative complications and is now independently mobile without aids She has not had any need for hospitalisation since the time of the knee replacement Medications Metformin 500mg bd, Amlodipine 5mg daily, Paracetamol 1g qid prn, What classes of medications are the first two listed? Metformin is a biguanide - diabetic medication Amlodipine is a calcium channel blocker (dihydropyridine) What is an example of a non-dihydropyridine (Verapamil, diltiazem) What is the difference in cardiovascular effect between DHP and non-DHP? (non-DHPs have greater negative inotropic effect) Examination You need to examine Maria\u2019s speech to see what it is the family are concerned about. What types of speech disturbance will you be looking for? What is the difference between dysphasia, dysarthria and dysphonia? Dysphasia Expressive aphasia Receptive aphasia Dysarthria Dysphonia Describe a system for examination of speech In the setting of possible stroke the NIH stroke scale would be performed and this includes screening tests for dysphasia (obeys commands-open close eyes/hands, describe the picture below and name the objects in the other picture) and dysarthria (read the words on the sheet). The students can be asked to think about the limitations here (how good is her English? Can she read? What would they do of the answer to either is no?) Ask a family member to help Involve a translator Screening = Ask something hard and if the patient can do it then they\u2019re probably OK Reception: Point to the ceiling after you point to the floor Repetition: Repeat after me: \u201cNo ifs ands or buts\u201d, \u201chippopotamus\u201d Language function is often clear after taking a history, but if not Naming: Collar, sleeve, cuff; knuckles Fluent speech: History or a task such as describing a picture, reading a paragraph What type of lesion (site central/peripheral) would be associated each type of speech disturbance? The areas associated with language and which are affected in dysphasia are the posterior temporal lobe (Wernicke\u2019s, language comprehension), posterior inferior frontal lobe (Broca\u2019s area, production of meaningful language) Dysarthria can result from both UMN and LMN lesions anywhere from motor cortex, cranial nerves, cerebellum or muscles involved in speech, Actually by the time you finish getting the brief description from the family (about 5 minutes) and start to examine Maria you find her speech has returned to normal. The family are a little surprised but relieved. You examine the rest of her neurological system and find that there are no signs of facial or limb weakness and she even gets up out of the bed and walks quite normally What else do you need to examine? Other focal neurological signs including weakness including motor drift, hemi-sensory loss, neglect, co-ordination, visual fields. Make sure the students are able to name all of these as part of their evaluation of the patient https://www.stroke.nih.gov/documents/NIH_Stroke_Scale_508C.pdf The remainder of the neurological examination including the cranial nerves is normal. What other neurological functions have you examined? The remainder of the neurological examination including the cranial nerves is normal. BP is 145/90 without a postural drop Her heart rate is 66 bpm and regular There are no cardiac murmurs or Carotid Bruit and she is afebrile There are no abnormalities on examination of the abdomen - What is the most likely working diagnosis at this point? - TIA - Are there any important differentials we need to exclude? - Migraine, Seizure, Hypoglycaemia, Stroke - Syncope/severe hypotension (but no dizziness) - What investigations would you like to perform? - Immediate: CTB and CT Arch to CoW - should be done for the stroke workup - ECG done for exclusion of AF or silent ischemia - Bloods: FBC, EUC, CMP (electrolyte, anemia, infection) - EUC needed (or a VBG can be done) to find SCr - needed if you order a CT Arch to CoW - BSL (also found on VBG) to exclude hypoglycaemia Investigations ECG normal, BSL normal, FBC EUC CMP LFT all normal, CTB: Multitrauma cases taking up scanners What will we do now? 1) send her home to see her GP in a couple of days 2) ask her to come to the next neurology clinic 3) admit her to the general ward overnight 4) admit her to the stroke unit for observation and further investigations What is her estimated risk of stroke in the next 2 days ABCD2 score - Her age >60, BP>140, unilateral weakness at the time of the episode and diabetes all increase the risk. The duration of symptoms is the other factor and that is unclear here. (The use of this score to define a group of lower risk patients who can have their investigations less urgently is now discouraged however we do know that more of these risk factors correlates to a higher risk of recurrent episodes as does the presence of recurrent episodes on history) Her ABCD2 score is at least 5 which puts her risk of stroke in the next 2 days between 4.1 and 8.1% - Maria is seen by the stroke team in ED, given some chewable aspirin immediately and transferred to the stroke unit - hand over to the stroke team - Students should use an ISBAR format to summarise their handover information. - Identify: Hi I am \u2026\u2026and I have been looking after Maria this morning as the JMO in ED - Situation: Maria has presented with acute onset of a speech deficit with facial and possible arm weakness noted by her family at 8 am this morning. This had fully resolved by the time she was assessed here in ED. - Background: Maria is normally very independent functionally but she is diabetic and being treated for hypertension - Assessment : Neuro exam, BP, BSL, ECG. She is waiting for a scan - Recommendation: The CT scanner is currently not free. She needs to have her imaging as soon as the scanner is available and should be admitted to the stroke unit if you are in agreement. Management Maria is seen by the stroke team in ED, given some chewable aspirin immediately and transferred to the stroke unit What happens in the stroke unit? She is also started on a statin and placed on regular BP and continuous cardiac monitoring She is booked for a CT angiogram (Arch to Circle of Willis), echocardiograph Holter monitor booked Bloods for tomorrow ordered, including FBC, EUC, CMP, LFT, HbA1c, fasting lipids Around 30 mins later (9am) the RN notes that her rhythm appears abnormal on the telemetry and organises a repeat ECG Her blood pressure and other observations have remained normal throughout Interpret and report on this ECG Rate: irregularly irregular, 72 BPM Rhythm: Irregularly irregular with no obvious p-waves Axis: Left-deviated axis P-wave absent PR interval NAD QRS complex < 0.12s, normal narrow complex ST segment - ?high takeoff point V2/V3 potentially elevated but does not reach STEMI criteria QT-interval normal T-wave normal, inverted I, aVL, V6 Progress Maria is still waiting for further cerebral imaging when the RN does her regular observations at 9.20am and notes that Maria has developed a dense right sided hemiplegia and dysphasia The stroke registrar is called and the radiology department is asked to move the CT angiogram to the urgent queue. Maria\u2019s family are called to come back from the coffee shop downstairs. What might be happening now? Re-infarct in same territory, likely ischemic in origin (Cardioembolic) Likely middle cerebral artery based on signs (Left) Still needs CT-brain non-con but now more urgent mechanisms of ischemic stroke: large vessel disease, cardioembolic, small vessel, venous infarction, vasculopathies Opacification of left MCA The CT excludes haemorrhage and the angiogram shows clot in the M1 segment of the left middle cerebral artery Intravenous thrombolysis is administered at 9.50am within 3 hours of the onset of symptoms Further questions Explain the mechanism of action of thrombolytic therapy and potential adverse reactions rtPA, streptokinin are both fibrinolytics What are the major contraindications and how long after the onset of symptoms is therapy indicated in acute stroke? ABSOLUTE contraindications Brain bleed: Recent haemorrhage stroke, head trauma, metastases/tumours Body bleed: ?aortic dissection, recent surgery in last 3 months Fibrinolytics In practice, relative contraindication is also SBP < 180mmHg Needs to be brought down before giving it Indication for thrombolysis is that it must be given within 4.5 hours of symptom onset - Is there any other treatment that could be used in this patient? ECR is performed for proximal/larger lesions (in M1 and M2 vessels typically) - time to treatment must be <24h for improved outcomes She is discussed with the interventional team at Royal North Shore and is accepted for transfer for consideration of endovascular clot retrieval Whilst in transit she has complete resolution of her symptoms and signs and does not undergo further treatment The echocardiogram is performed at RNSH to complete her diagnostic work-up and shows some mild atrial dilatation only.

What types of speech disturbance will you be looking for? What is the difference between dysphasia, dysarthria and dysphonia? Dysphasia Expressive aphasia Receptive aphasia Dysarthria Dysphonia Describe a system for examination of speech In the setting of possible stroke the NIH stroke scale would be performed and this includes screening tests for dysphasia (obeys commands-open close eyes/hands, describe the picture below and name the objects in the other picture) and dysarthria (read the words on the sheet). The students can be asked to think about the limitations here (how good is her English? Can she read? What would they do of the answer to either is no?) Ask a family member to help Involve a translator Screening = Ask something hard and if the patient can do it then they\u2019re probably OK Reception: Point to the ceiling after you point to the floor Repetition: Repeat after me: \u201cNo ifs ands or buts\u201d, \u201chippopotamus\u201d Language function is often clear after taking a history, but if not Naming: Collar, sleeve, cuff; knuckles Fluent speech: History or a task such as describing a picture, reading a paragraph What type of lesion (site central/peripheral) would be associated each type of speech disturbance? The areas associated with language and which are affected in dysphasia are the posterior temporal lobe (Wernicke\u2019s, language comprehension), posterior inferior frontal lobe (Broca\u2019s area, production of meaningful language) Dysarthria can result from both UMN and LMN lesions anywhere from motor cortex, cranial nerves, cerebellum or muscles involved in speech, Actually by the time you finish getting the brief description from the family (about 5 minutes) and start to examine Maria you find her speech has returned to normal. The family are a little surprised but relieved. You examine the rest of her neurological system and find that there are no signs of facial or limb weakness and she even gets up out of the bed and walks quite normally What else do you need to examine? Other focal neurological signs including weakness including motor drift, hemi-sensory loss, neglect, co-ordination, visual fields.

The duration of symptoms is the other factor and that is unclear here. (The use of this score to define a group of lower risk patients who can have their investigations less urgently is now discouraged however we do know that more of these risk factors correlates to a higher risk of recurrent episodes as does the presence of recurrent episodes on history) Her ABCD2 score is at least 5 which puts her risk of stroke in the next 2 days between 4.1 and 8.1% - Maria is seen by the stroke team in ED, given some chewable aspirin immediately and transferred to the stroke unit - hand over to the stroke team - Students should use an ISBAR format to summarise their handover information. - Identify: Hi I am \u2026\u2026and I have been looking after Maria this morning as the JMO in ED - Situation: Maria has presented with acute onset of a speech deficit with facial and possible arm weakness noted by her family at 8 am this morning.
