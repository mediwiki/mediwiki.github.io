Method of administration. Self-administered by SC injection in abdomen, buttocks, arm, and leg. Given intravenously for emergency ketoacidosis. b. Regimens Most type I diabetic patients require 0.5 to 1.0 unit/kg per day to achieve acceptable glycemic control. Start with a conservative dose (0.2 units/kg) and adjust the regimen according to the patient\u2019s glucose levels. Many different regimens exist, and every patient has unique needs (see Table 4-5). c. Intensive insulin therapy Long-acting insulin is given once daily in the evening. Regular insulin is given 30 to 45 minutes before each meal, and should be adjusted according to preprandial home glucose measurements. These more aggressive therapies have been shown to significantly decrease the incidence of diabetes complications such as retinopathy and microalbuminuria when compared to prior regimens. All attempts should be made to get patients on more aggressive treatment protocols. With intensive insulin therapy, the risk for hypoglycemia is a serious concern. Alternatively, a continuous SC infusion of insulin can be given via an insulin pump. Preprandial boluses are given in addition to the basal infusion. d. If the patient is unable/unwilling to carry out an intensive insulin program: Give 70/30 units before breakfast and before the evening meal for basal coverage. Give a short-acting insulin (regular) for prandial control if necessary. Adjust doses according to fasting and 4 PM glucose determinations. e. Inpatient management of diabetic patients (sliding scale). An insulin sliding scale (SSI) of regular insulin doses given according to bedside finger-stick glucose determinations is helpful in controlling blood glucose levels in the hospital setting. SSI should be used in addition to a regimen of long-acting insulin. If given alone, hyperglycemia usually results. Monitor blood glucose four times per day: before meals and at bedtime. Once insulin therapy is started, a blood glucose goal of 140 to 180 mg/dL should be targeted for most patients. If the home insulin dose is unclear, or if the patient anticipates greater requirements of insulin due to an illness, use the following approach to adjust appropriate insulin doses: Take the total number of units of regular insulin that the patient required in 1 day (while on the sliding scale). Add two-thirds of this to the prebreakfast dose and one-third before dinner. It should be given as 70/30 (i.e., 70% NPH/30% regular). In practice, remember that often patients will be placed on a basal-bolus dosing with long- and short-acting insulin with meals. f. Modifying insulin doses (see also Clinical Pearl 4-3) Physical activity\u2014depending on the intensity of the activity, decrease insulin dosage 1 to 2 units per 20 to 30 minutes of activity.

A minority of patients have a prolonged course or recurrent symptoms Complications Pericardial effusion Cardiac tamponade \u2014can occur in up to 15% of patients; close observation is important Clinical Features Chest pain (most common finding) Often severe and pleuritic (can differentiate from pain of MI because of association with breathing), 'sharp'. Often localized to the retrosternal and left precordial regions and radiates to the trapezius ridge and neck.

Treat the underlying cause if known. First line: First-line therapy is high-dose NSAIDs (aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen, or indomethacin). Colchicine is recommended as adjunctive therapy in addition to NSAIDs. Colchicine enhances the response to NSAIDs and also aids in reducing the risk of recurrent pericarditis. This drug is concentrated in and interferes with the migration of neutrophils, may cause diarrhea and other gastrointestinal side effects, and is contraindicated in patients with hepatic or renal dysfunction. Second line: Glucocorticoids may be tried if pain does not respond to NSAIDs, but should be avoided if at all possible, as they are associated with a high rate of recurrent pericarditis.

It is the most common primary cardiac neoplasm. The majority of myxomas are sporadic, but autosomal-dominant transmission has been noted. Although benign, atrial myxomas can embolize, leading to metastatic disease, or can cause relative valvular dysfunction. Clinical features Prototypically present with fatigue, fever, syncope, palpitations, malaise, and a lowpitched diastolic murmur that changes character with changing body positions (diastolic plop). murmur will change depending on position Diagnosis Echocardiogram? CT? Treatment Surgical excision. Summary Cardiac myxomas are the most common type of primary tumor of the heart . They are usually benign and arise from primary connective tissue . Most cardiac myxomas arise sporadically; however, 10% are hereditary (following an autosomal dominant pattern). Even though they may develop in any chamber of the heart , most (\u223c 75 %) cardiac myxomas arise in the left atrium , usually from the interatrial septum , while the rest occur in the right atrium (ventricular myxomas are rare). Clinical features are primarily caused by obstruction of the blood flow through the heart and include dyspnea on exertion, palpitations, syncope , weight loss, or even sudden death. Rarely, life-threatening conditions (e.g., stroke ) may result from an embolization from the myxoma. Typical examination findings include abnormal heart sounds , such as a rumbling diastolic murmur over the apex or a characteristic \u201c tumor plop.\u201d The diagnosis is not easily established clinically because of the nonspecific nature of symptoms.

Premature atrial complexes (PACs) are found in more than 50% of normal adults who undergo Holter monitoring and are of no significance in a normal heart, but may be a precursor of ischemia in a diseased heart. May cause palpitations or give rise to PSVTs.

PACS arising close to the AV node (\u201clow atrial\u201d ectopics) activate the atria retrogradely, producing an inverted P wave with a relatively short PR interval \u2265 120 ms (PR interval < 120 ms is classified as a PJC). PACs that reach the SA node may depolarise it, causing the SA node to \u201creset\u201d \u2014 this results in a longer-than-normal interval before the next sinus beat arrives (\u201cpost-extrasystolic pause\u201d). Unlike with PVCs, this pause is not equal to double the preceding RR interval (i.e. not a \u201cfull compensatory pause\u201d). PACs arriving early in the cycle may be conducted aberrantly, usually with a RBBB morphology (as the right bundle branch has a longer refractory period than the left). They can be differentiated from PVCs by the presence of a preceding P wave. Similarly, PACs arriving very early in the cycle may not be conducted to the ventricles at all. In this case, you will see an abnormal P wave that is not followed by a QRS complex (\u201cblocked PAC\u201d). It is usually followed by a compensatory pause as the sinus node resets. Classification of Premature Atrial Complex (PAC) PACs may be either: Unifocal \u2013 Arising from a single ectopic focus; each PAC is identical. Multifocal \u2013 Arising from two or more ectopic foci; multiple P-wave morphologies. PACs often occur in repeating patterns: Bigeminy \u2014 every other beat is a PAC. Trigeminy \u2014 every third beat is a PAC. Quadrigeminy \u2014 every fourth beat is a PAC. Couplet \u2013 two consecutive PACs. Triplet \u2014 three consecutive PACs. Diagnosis On ECG, look for early P waves that differ in morphology from the normal sinus P wave (because these P waves originate within the atria and not the sinus node). QRS complex is normal because conduction below the atria is normal. There is usually a pause before the next sinus P wave. There is an aberrantly conducted PAC, best seen in aVL and aVF (circled). This could be mistaken for a ventricular ectopic \u2014 however, it is clearly preceded by an abnormal P wave. A normally-conducted PAC is also present on the rhythm strip (circled). Treatment Usually asymptomatic and do not require treatment. Monitor for increased frequency. If symptomatic (e.g., palpitations), \u03b2-blockers may be helpful.

May lead to a paroxysmal tachycardia, which can be produced by two possible mechanisms: Orthodromic reciprocating tachycardia (orthodromic AVRT) The impulse travels through the AV node (anterograde limb) and depolarizes the ventricles. Then it travels back through the accessory pathway (the retrograde limb) and depolarizes the atria again, creating a reentry loop. No delta waves because conduction occurs retrograde over the accessory pathway. Supraventricular tachycardias (AFib or atrial flutter) Usually, AV node only allows certain impulses to get to ventricles. With an accessory pathway, all or most of the impulses may pass to the ventricles. A fast ventricular rate may occur and cause hemodynamic compromise. Associated disorders HOCM mitral valve prolapse Ebstein's anomaly thyrotoxicosis secundum ASD B. Diagnosis ECG: Narrow complex tachycardia, a short PR interval (usually <100 ms), and a delta wave (upward deflection seen before the QRS complex) C. Treatment Radiofrequency catheter ablation of one arm of the reentrant loop (i.e., of the accessory pathway) is an effective treatment. Medical options include procainamide or quinidine. Avoid drugs active on the AV node (e.g., digoxin, CCBs, \u03b2-blockers, adenosine) because they may accelerate conduction through the accessory pathway, resulting in VFib. Type IA antiarrhythmics (i.e., procainamide , disopyramide, quinidine ) are better choices, as they will suppress conduction through the accessory pathway instead. Pathophysiology case study A 25-year-old man presents to the hospital with light-headedness and palpitations for the past 2 hours. He had four or five previous episodes of palpitations in the past, but they had lasted only a few minutes and went away on their own. These episodes were not associated with any specific activity or diet. He denies any chest pain. On physical examination, he is noted to be tachycardic with a heart rate of 180 bpm and a blood pressure of 105/70 mm Hg. An ECG shows a narrow complex tachycardia at 180 bpm. The tachycardia terminates suddenly, and the patient\u2019s heart rate drops to 90 bpm. A repeat ECG shows sinus rhythm with a short PR interval and a wide QRS with a slurred upstroke (delta wave). The patient is diagnosed as having Wolff\u2013Parkinson\u2013White syndrome. Questions What is the significance of the delta wave on this patient\u2019s ECG? The delta wave is indicative of the slow depolarisation of the ventricles through the bundle of kent (or a result of the electrical leakage via the bundle of kent?) The atrioventricular (AV) node normally forms the only electrical connection between the atria and the ventricles. However, an accessory AV connection is found in approximately 1 in 1000 persons. This accessory pathway is usually composed of normal atrial or ventricular tissue. Because part of the ventricle is \u201cpre-excited\u201d over the accessory pathway, rather than via the AV node, the surface ECG shows a short PR interval and a relatively wide QRS with a slurred upstroke, termed a delta wave. How are re-entrant tachycardias initiated in this condition? Re-entrant tachycardias result from the pre-excitation of the LA (and thus AV node) by leakage currents from the LV via the bundle of kent Because the atria and ventricles are linked by two parallel connections, re-entrant tachycardias are readily initiated. For example, a premature atrial contraction could be blocked in the accessory pathway but still conduct to the ventricles via the AV node. If enough time has elapsed that the accessory pathway has recovered excitability, the cardiac impulse can travel in retrograde fashion to the atria over the accessory pathway and initiate a re-entrant tachycardia. What are two other mechanisms that give rise to tachycardias? AVNRT - resulting from fast/slow nodal conduction at the AV node First, an increased automaticity resulting from more rapid phase 4 depolarizations can cause rapid heart rate. Second, if repolarization is delayed (longer plateau period), spontaneous depolarizations (caused by the reactivation of sodium or calcium channels) can sometimes occur in phase 3 or phase 4 of the action potential. These depolarizations are called \u201ctriggered activity\u201d because they depend on the existence of a preceding action potential. If these depolarizations reach threshold, tachycardia can occur in certain pathologic conditions.","title":"Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) Syndrome"},{"location":"IM/Cardiology/Wolff-Parkinson-White%20%28WPW%29%20Syndrome.html#wolff-parkinson-white-wpw-syndrome","text":"","title":"Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) Syndrome"},{"location":"IM/Cardiology/Wolff-Parkinson-White%20%28WPW%29%20Syndrome.html#general-characteristics","text":"An accessory conduction pathway from atria to ventricles through the bundle of Kent causes premature ventricular excitation because it lacks the delay seen in the AV node. May lead to a paroxysmal tachycardia, which can be produced by two possible mechanisms: Orthodromic reciprocating tachycardia (orthodromic AVRT) The impulse travels through the AV node (anterograde limb) and depolarizes the ventricles. Then it travels back through the accessory pathway (the retrograde limb) and depolarizes the atria again, creating a reentry loop. No delta waves because conduction occurs retrograde over the accessory pathway. Supraventricular tachycardias (AFib or atrial flutter) Usually, AV node only allows certain impulses to get to ventricles.

Spirono is still the preferred first-line treatment) \u2022 Note that these patients may be on a non-K-sparing diuretic simply because they seem to have hypertension.

Elevated levels lead to water retention and excretion of concentrated urine. This has two major effects: hyponatremia and volume expansion. Despite volume expansion, edema is not seen in syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH). This is because natriuresis (excretion of excessive sodium in urine) occurs despite hyponatremia. Reasons for natriuresis Volume expansion causes an increase in atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) which increases urine sodium excretion.

Cancer is found in 4% to 10% of nodules that are investigated. 2. A solitary nodule can be either thyroid cancer or a benign adenoma. However, multinodular conditions may cause confusion because only one of these nodules may be palpable. 3. The most important function of the physical examination is the detection of the thyroid nodule, rather than the determination of its benign or malignant status. 4. To be detectable on palpation, a nodule must be at least 1 cm in diameter. 5. Malignancy is suggested by the following: a. If the nodule is fixed in place and no movement occurs on swallowing b. Unusually firm consistency or irregularity of the nodule c. If the nodule is solitary d. History of radiation therapy to the neck e. History of rapid development f. Vocal cord paralysis (recurrent laryngeal nerve paralysis) g. Cervical adenopathy h. Elevated serum calcitonin i. Family history of thyroid cancer B. Diagnosis 1. Initial workup should include history, physical exam, ultrasound of neck and TSH. 2. Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy (see also Clinical Pearl 4-9) a. FNA has a sensitivity of 95% and a specificity of 95%. Therefore, if FNA shows a benign nodule, the nodule is likely to be benign. b. However, FNA biopsies have 5% false-negative results, so follow up with periodic FNA if thyroid nodularity persists. Benign lesions should continue to show consistently benign cytology. c. FNA is reliable for all cancers (papillary, medullary, anaplastic) except follicular. 3. Thyroid scan (radioactive iodine) (Figure 4-5) a. Thyroid scan plays a supplemental role. It is performed if the FNA biopsy is indeterminate. It is also performed in patients with a low TSH, as these patients are more likely to have a hyperfunctioning nodule. b. It gives graphic representations of the distribution of radioactive iodine in the gland\u2014useful in identifying whether thyroid nodules show decreased (\u201ccold\u201d) or increased (\u201chot\u201d) accumulation of radioactive iodine compared with normal paranodular tissue. Nodules are classified as \u201ccold\u201d (hypofunctional), \u201cwarm\u201d (normally functioning), or \u201chot\u201d (hyperfunctional). c. It should be limited to patients whose FNA biopsy results suggest neoplasm. (It is not cost effective to scan all patients with thyroid nodules.)

Risk factors - Obesity (greatest risk factor) - Genetics - Age (insulin production decreases with age) b. Obesity plays a major role - Obesity is associated with increased plasma levels of free fatty acids, which make muscles more insulin resistant, reducing glucose uptake. - Therefore, obesity exacerbates insulin resistance. - In the liver, free fatty acids increase the production of glucose. c. Lack of compensation in type II diabetic patients - In normal individuals, the pancreas secretes more insulin in response to free fatty acids, thus neutralizing the excess glucose. - In type II diabetic patients, free fatty acids fail to stimulate pancreatic insulin secretion. Therefore, compensation does not occur and hyperglycemia develops; \u03b2-cells become desensitized to glucose, leading to decreased insulin secretion. Management Diet and exercise should ideally be the only interventions in most type II diabetic patients. a. Diet and exercise are especially effective in obese and sedentary patients (who constitute the majority of type II diabetic patients). b. Most patients, however, do not lose enough weight to control glucose levels through diet and exercise alone, and will require pharmacologic treatment. c. Glycemic control minimizes risks for nephropathy, neuropathy, and retinopathy in both Type 1 and 2 DM, and decreases risk for cardiovascular disease for Type 1 DM. Oral hypoglycemic drugs (see Table 4-4) a. Use these in type II diabetic patients when conservative therapy (diet and exercise) fails. b. Start with one agent; metformin is best initial drug therapy. If monotherapy fails, use two agents from different classes in combination. Each agent has advantages and disadvantages, so clinical judgment is required in selecting the agent. c. Metformin blocks gluconeogenesis. It is contraindicated in patients with renal failure. d.

There are numerous studies evaluating cardiovascular benefits of SGLT2 inhibitor therapy in high-risk CVD patients. f. In patients with relatively mild disease, use of these drugs (alone or in combination) can bring glucose levels to normal, but patients with severe disease often do not respond adequately. Therefore, many type II diabetic patients eventually require insulin (see below). g. Do not give to patients who cannot eat (e.g., because of illness or surgery).

The creatinine may be normal despite a markedly reduced glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in the early stages of acute kidney injury (AKI) due to the time it takes for creatinine to accumulate in the body. This condition is also called acute renal failure (ARF). One consensus definition of AKI is called the RIFLE criteria. RISK: 1.5-fold increase in the serum creatinine or GFR decrease by 25% or urine output <0.5 mL/kg/hr for 6 hours. INJURY: Twofold increase in the serum creatinine or GFR decrease by 50% or urine output <0.5 mL/kg/hr for 12 hours. FAILURE: Threefold increase in the serum creatinine or GFR decrease by 75% or urine output of <0.5 mL/kg/hr for 24 hours, or anuria for 12 hours. LOSS: Complete loss of kidney function (i.e., requiring dialysis) for more than 4 weeks. ESRD: Complete loss of kidney function (i.e., requiring dialysis) for more than 3 months. Approach AKI may be nonoliguric, oliguric, or anuric. Severe AKI may occur without a reduction in urine output (nonoliguric AKI). General goals of therapy are reversing the initial insult to the kidney and/or supportive care as GFR recovers, as well as preventing fulminant kidney failure requiring temporary or permanent hemodialysis. Weight gain and edema are most common findings in patients with AKI. This is due to a positive water and sodium (Na+) balance. Characterized by azotemia (elevated BUN and Cr) Elevated BUN is also seen with catabolic drugs (e.g., steroids), GI/soft tissue bleeding (due to RBC digestion and re-absorption of urea), and dietary protein intake. Elevated Cr is also seen with increased muscle breakdown and various drugs. The baseline Cr level varies proportionately with muscle mass. Prognosis More than 80% of patients in whom AKI develops recover completely. However, prognosis varies widely depending on the severity of renal failure and other comorbidities. The older the patient and the more severe the insult, the lower is the likelihood of complete recovery. The most common cause of death is infection (75% of all deaths), followed by cardiorespiratory complications. Other nonfatal complications include chronic kidney injury and need for dialysis Life-threatening consequences volume overload hypoerkalaemia metabolic acidosis Risk factors: Diabetes, HTN, Elderly Approach Prerenal failure a. Most common cause of AKI; potentially reversible b. Etiology (decrease in systemic arterial blood volume or renal perfusion leading to renal ischemia)\u2014can complicate any disease that causes hypovolemia, low cardiac output, or systemic vasodilation Hypovolemia\u2014dehydration, excessive diuretic use, poor fluid intake, vomiting, diarrhea, burns, hemorrhage, CHF, cardiorenal syndrome Hypotension (systolic BP below 90 mm Hg), from sepsis, excessive, antihypertensive medications, bleeding, dehydration Renal arterial obstruction (kidney is hypoperfused despite elevated blood pressure) Cirrhosis, hepatorenal syndrome In patients with decreased renal perfusion, NSAIDs (constrict afferent arteriole), ACE inhibitors (cause efferent arteriole vasodilation), and cyclosporin can precipitate prerenal failure. Pathophysiology Renal blood flow decreases enough to lower the GFR, which leads to decreased clearance of metabolites (BUN, Cr, uremic toxins). Because the renal parenchyma is undamaged, tubular function (and therefore the concentrating ability) is preserved. Therefore, the kidney responds appropriately, conserving as much sodium and water as possible. This form of AKI is reversible on restoration of blood flow; but if hypoperfusion persists, ischemia results and can lead to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) Clinical features signs of volume depletion (dry mucous membranes, hypotension, tachycardia, decreased tissue turgor, oliguria/anuria) Diagnosis and Investigations Oliguria\u2014always found in prerenal failure (this is to preserve volume) Increased BUN-to-serum Cr ratio (>20:1 is the classic ratio)\u2014because kidney can reabsorb urea to increase sodium and water retention Increased urine osmolality (>500 mOsm/kg H2O)\u2014because the kidney is able to appropriately reabsorb water Decreased urine Na+ (<20 mEq/L with fractional excretion of sodium [FENa] <1%) because Na+ is avidly reabsorbed Increased urine\u2013plasma Cr ratio (>40:1)\u2014because much of the filtrate is reabsorbed (but not the creatinine) Bland urine sediment, indicating lack of significant cellular damage to glomeruli or tubules Intrinsic renal failure a. Kidney tissue (interstitium, glomeruli, tubules) is damaged such that glomerular filtration and tubular function are significantly impaired. Thus, kidneys are unable to concentrate urine effectively. b. Causes Tubular disease (ATN)\u2014can be caused by ischemia (most common cause), nephrotoxins (see Clinical Pearls 7-3 and 7-4) Glomerular disease (acute glomerulonephritis [GN])\u2014for example, Goodpasture syndrome, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, poststreptococcal GN, lupus Vascular disease\u2014for example, renal artery occlusion, TTP, HUS Interstitial disease\u2014for example, allergic interstitial nephritis, often due to a hypersensitivity reaction to medication c. Clinical features depend on the cause. Edema is usually present. Recovery may be possible but takes longer than in prerenal failure. d. Laboratory findings Decreased BUN-to-serum Cr ratio (<20:1, typically closer to 10:1 ratio) in comparison with prerenal failure. Both BUN and Cr levels are still elevated, but less urea is reabsorbed than in prerenal failure as kidney is no longer actively reabsorbing it. Increased urine Na+ (>40 mEq/L with FENa > 2% to 3%)\u2014because Na+ is poorly reabsorbed Decreased urine osmolality (<350 mOsm/kg H2O)\u2014because renal water reabsorption is impaired Decreased urine\u2013plasma Cr ratio (<20:1)\u2014because filtrate cannot be reabsorbed Postrenal failure a. Least common cause of AKI b. Obstruction of any segment of the urinary tract (with intact kidney) causes increased tubular pressure (urine produced cannot be excreted), which leads to decreased GFR. Blood supply and renal parenchyma are intact. Note that both kidneys must be obstructed (e.g., prostatic enlargement) for creatinine to rise. c. Renal function is restored if obstruction is relieved before the kidneys are damaged. d. Postrenal obstruction, if untreated, can lead to ATN. e. Causes Urethral obstruction secondary to enlarged prostate (BPH) is the most common cause Obstruction of solitary kidney Nephrolithiasis Obstructing neoplasm (bladder, cervix, prostate, and so on) Retroperitoneal fibrosis Ureteral obstruction is an uncommon cause because obstruction must be bilateral to cause renal failure. Diagnosis Blood tests EUC, FBC, LFT, Coags, ESR, CRP, CK Unclear cause - consider GMs Serum IG, electrophoresis, C3/C4, ASOT, Autoantibodies (ANA, ANCA, anti-dsDNA, anti-GBM) a. Elevation in BUN and Cr levels. Be aware that small changes in Cr may reflect a much more significant decrease in GFR. b. Electrolytes (retention of K+, PO4 3\u2212, drop in HCO3 \u2212 indicating acidosis, decrease in Na+ due to fluid retention) c. Albumin levels to monitor for nephrotic syndrome d. CBC with differential Urinalysis (Figure 7-2 and Table 7-2). a. A dipstick test positive for protein (3+, 4+) suggests intrinsic renal failure due to glomerular insult. b. Microscopic examination of the urine sediment: Crystals indicate presence of stones. Micro-organisms are seen in both infection and nonpathogenic colonization (differentiation made based on symptoms). Granular casts degeneration of cells and protein aggregates seen in ATN (\u201cmuddy brown\u201d casts) Hyaline casts are devoid of contents (seen in prerenal failure). RBC casts indicate glomerular disease. WBC casts indicate renal parenchymal inflammation. Fatty casts indicate nephrotic syndrome. Urine chemistry\u2014to distinguish between different forms of AKI. a. Urine Na+, Cr, and osmolality: Urine Na+ depends on dietary intake. b. FENa: collect urine and plasma electrolytes simultaneously = [(UNa )/(PNa )/(UCr)/PCr) \u00d7 100], where U = urine and P = plasma. Values below 1% suggest prerenal failure. Values above 2% to 3% suggest ATN. FENa is most useful if oliguria is present. If patient is on diuretics, UNa will be artificially elevated and fractional excretion of urea (FEUrea) must be used instead. c. Renal failure index 5 (uNa/[uCr/pCr]) \u00d7 100) Values below 1% suggest prerenal failure. Values above 1% suggest ATN. Urine culture and sensitivities\u2014if infection is suspected. Renal ultrasound. a. Primarily useful for evaluating kidney size and for excluding urinary tract obstruction (i.e., postrenal failure)\u2014presence of bilateral hydronephrosis or hydroureter b. Order for most patients with AKI\u2014unless the cause of the AKI is obvious and is not postrenal CT scan (abdomen and pelvis)\u2014may be helpful in some cases; usually done if renal ultrasound shows an abnormality such as hydronephrosis Renal biopsy\u2014useful occasionally if there is suspicion of acute GN or acute allergic interstitial nephritis Renal arteriography\u2014to evaluate for possible renal artery occlusion; should be performed only if specific therapy will make a difference CXR - pulmonary oedema ECG - hyperkalaemic changes Complications ECF volume expansion and resulting pulmonary edema\u2014treat with a diuretic (furosemide) Metabolic a. Hyperkalemia\u2014due to decreased excretion of K+ and the movement of potassium from ICF to ECF due to tissue destruction and acidosis b. Metabolic acidosis (with increased anion gap)\u2014due to decreased excretion of hydrogen ions; if severe (below 16 mEq/L), correct with sodium bicarbonate c. Hypocalcemia\u2014loss of ability to form active vitamin D and rapid development of PTH resistance d. Hyponatremia may occur if water intake is greater than body losses, or if a volume-depleted patient consumes excessive hypotonic solutions. (Hypernatremia may also be seen in hypovolemic states.) e. Hyperphosphatemia\u2014due to decreased clearance f. Hyperuricemia Uremia\u2014toxic end products of metabolism accumulate (especially from protein metabolism), leading to such complications as: a. Platelet dysfunction b. Immune dysfunction c. Pericarditis d. Encephalopathy Infection a. A common and serious complication of AKI (occurs in 50% to 60% of cases). The cause is probably multifactorial, but uremia itself is thought to impair immune function. b. Examples include pneumonia, UTI, wound infection, and sepsis. Treatment General measures (see also Table 7-3). a. Avoid medications that decrease renal blood flow (NSAIDs) and/or that are nephrotoxic (e.g., aminoglycosides, radiocontrast agents). b. Adjust medication dosages for level of renal function. c. Correct fluid imbalance. If volume depleted, give IV fluids. However, many patients with AKI are volume overloaded (especially if they are oliguric or anuric), so diuresis may be necessary IF SYMPTOMATIC The goal is to strike a balance between correcting volume deficits and avoiding volume overload (while maintaining adequate urine output). Remember that urine output is a reflection of renal blood flow (volume status) and GFR (kidney function). Monitor fluid balance by daily weight measurements (most accurate estimate) and intake\u2013output records. Be sure to take into account the patient\u2019s cardiac history when considering treatment options for fluid imbalances (i.e., do not give excessive fluid to a patient with CHF). d. Correct electrolyte disturbances if present. e. Optimize cardiac output. BP should be approximately 120 to 140/80 to 90. f. Order dialysis if symptomatic uremia, intractable acidemia, hyperkalemia, or volume overload develop. Indications for urgent dialysis often remembered by \u201cAEIOU\u201d mnemonic: Acidosis, Electrolytes, Intoxications (such as in overdoses), volume Overload, Uremia. Prerenal a. Treat the underlying disorder (such as hypovolemic or cardiogenic shock). b. Give fluids to maintain euvolemia and restore blood pressure\u2014do not give to patients with edema or ascites. May be necessary to stop antihypertensive medications. Remember that NS is often preferred unless acidemia is present (may worsen with hyperchloremia), in which case LR can be used. c. Eliminate any offending agents (ACE inhibitors, NSAIDs). d. If patient is unstable, Swan\u2013Ganz monitoring for accurate assessment of intravascular volume. Intrinsic a. Once ATN develops, therapy is supportive and renal function generally recovers. Eliminate the cause/offending agent. b. If oliguric, a trial of furosemide may help to increase urine flow. This improves fluid balance. Postrenal\u2014a bladder catheter may be inserted to decompress the urinary tract. Consider urology consultation. a. Be aware of the potential for post-obstructive diuresis and a rapid increase in urine output when obstruction is resolved, which may require IV fluid replacement.","title":"Acute kidney injury (AKI)"},{"location":"IM/Nephrology/Acute%20Kidney%20Injury.html#acute-kidney-injury-aki","text":"","title":"Acute kidney injury (AKI)"},{"location":"IM/Nephrology/Acute%20Kidney%20Injury.html#background","text":"","title":"Background"},{"location":"IM/Nephrology/Acute%20Kidney%20Injury.html#definition","text":"A rapid decline in renal function over hours or days, with an increase in serum creatinine level while the cutoff for rise in creatinine which qualifies as an \u201cinjury\u201d is controversial, an increase of as little as 0.3 mg/dL may have clinical relevance, while traditional definitions describe a relative increase of 50% or an absolute increase of 0.5 to 1.0 mg/dL).

Avoid medications that decrease renal blood flow (NSAIDs) and/or that are nephrotoxic (e.g., aminoglycosides, radiocontrast agents). b. Adjust medication dosages for level of renal function. c. Correct fluid imbalance. If volume depleted, give IV fluids. However, many patients with AKI are volume overloaded (especially if they are oliguric or anuric), so diuresis may be necessary IF SYMPTOMATIC The goal is to strike a balance between correcting volume deficits and avoiding volume overload (while maintaining adequate urine output). Remember that urine output is a reflection of renal blood flow (volume status) and GFR (kidney function). Monitor fluid balance by daily weight measurements (most accurate estimate) and intake\u2013output records. Be sure to take into account the patient\u2019s cardiac history when considering treatment options for fluid imbalances (i.e., do not give excessive fluid to a patient with CHF). d. Correct electrolyte disturbances if present. e. Optimize cardiac output. BP should be approximately 120 to 140/80 to 90. f. Order dialysis if symptomatic uremia, intractable acidemia, hyperkalemia, or volume overload develop. Indications for urgent dialysis often remembered by \u201cAEIOU\u201d mnemonic: Acidosis, Electrolytes, Intoxications (such as in overdoses), volume Overload, Uremia. Prerenal a. Treat the underlying disorder (such as hypovolemic or cardiogenic shock). b. Give fluids to maintain euvolemia and restore blood pressure\u2014do not give to patients with edema or ascites. May be necessary to stop antihypertensive medications. Remember that NS is often preferred unless acidemia is present (may worsen with hyperchloremia), in which case LR can be used. c. Eliminate any offending agents (ACE inhibitors, NSAIDs). d. If patient is unstable, Swan\u2013Ganz monitoring for accurate assessment of intravascular volume. Intrinsic a. Once ATN develops, therapy is supportive and renal function generally recovers. Eliminate the cause/offending agent. b. If oliguric, a trial of furosemide may help to increase urine flow. This improves fluid balance. Postrenal\u2014a bladder catheter may be inserted to decompress the urinary tract. Consider urology consultation. a. Be aware of the potential for post-obstructive diuresis and a rapid increase in urine output when obstruction is resolved, which may require IV fluid replacement.","title":"Treatment"},{"location":"IM/Nephrology/Approach%20to%20Acid-Base%20disorders.html","text":"","title":"Approach to Acid Base disorders"},{"location":"IM/Nephrology/Approach%20to%20Hematuria.html","text":"","title":"Approach to Hematuria"},{"location":"IM/Nephrology/Chronic%20Kidney%20Injury.html","text":"Chronic Kidney Disease A.

General Characteristics 1. Overview a. Dialysis is the artificial mechanism by which fluid and toxic solutes are removed from the circulation when the kidneys cannot do so sufficiently. b. In all forms of dialysis, the blood interfaces with an artificial solution resembling human plasma (called the dialysate), and diffusion of fluid and solutes occurs across a semipermeable membrane. c. The two major methods of dialyzing a patient are hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis (discussed below). d. The majority of dialysis patients in the United States receive hemodialysis at hospitals or dialysis centers, but more and more patients are opting for chronic ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). e. For patients with life-threatening complications of AKI, continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) can be used for constant renal support. This also avoids the larger fluid shifts of intermittent hemodialysis which hemodynamically unstable or heart failure patients may not be able to handle. B. When to Initiate Dialysis 1. General settings in which dialysis is considered. a. CKD\u2014dialysis serves as a bridge to renal transplantation or as a permanent treatment when the patient is not a transplantation candidate. b. AKI\u2014dialysis is often required as a temporary measure until the patient\u2019s renal function improves, often due to absolute indications (see Quick Hit). c. Overdose of medications or ingestions of substances cleared by the kidneys\u2014 some, but not all medications and toxins can be dialyzed (see Quick Hit). 2. Nonemergent indications a. Note: Cr and BUN levels are not absolute indications for dialysis, however some nephrologists will decide to initiate dialysis once a CKD patient\u2019s GFR drops below a certain value. b. Symptoms of uremia Nausea and vomiting Lethargy/deterioration in mental status, encephalopathy, seizures Pericarditis Emergent indications (usually in the setting of renal failure) a. Life-threatening manifestations of volume overload Pulmonary edema Hypertensive emergency refractory to antihypertensive agents b. Severe, refractory electrolyte disturbances, for example, hyperkalemia, hypermagnesemia c. Severe metabolic acidosis d. Drug toxicity/ingestions (particularly in patients with renal failure): methanol, ethylene glycol, lithium, aspirin C. Hemodialysis 1. Process a. The patient\u2019s blood is pumped by an artificial pump outside of the body through the dialyzer, which typically consists of fine capillary networks of semipermeable membranes. The dialysate flows on the outside of these networks, and fluid and solutes diffuse across the membrane. b. The patient\u2019s blood must be heparinized to prevent clotting in the dialyzer. 2. Frequency: Most hemodialysis patients require 3 to 5 hours of dialysis 3 days per week. 3. Access a. Use the central catheter placed using the Seldinger technique most often in the subclavian or jugular vein for temporary access. b. Tunneled catheters are placed under the skin which leads to a lower rate of infection. These catheters are often suitable for use up to 6 months. c. Arteriovenous fistula. Best form of permanent dialysis access. It requires vascular surgery to connect the radial or brachial artery to veins in the forearm. An audible bruit and palpable thrill (due to high flow) over the fistula indicates that it is patent. Absence of these findings is abnormal and is concerning for thrombosis of the vessel. d. An alternative to an arteriovenous fistula is an implantable graft\u2014typically made of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE). 4. Alternatives to traditional hemodialysis. a. Continuous arteriovenous hemodialysis (CAVHD) and continuous venovenous hemodialysis (CVVHD) are often used in hemodynamically unstable patients, such as ICU patients with AKI. This allows for closer control of electrolytes and fluid status. b. Lower flow rates of blood and dialysate enable dialysis to occur while minimizing rapid shifts in volume and osmolality which these patients may not be able to tolerate. c. They require highly efficient dialyzers to be effective. 5. Advantages of hemodialysis. a. It is more efficient than peritoneal dialysis. High flow rates and efficient dialyzers shorten the period of time required for dialysis. b. It can be initiated more quickly than peritoneal dialysis, using temporary vascular access in the emergent setting. 6. Disadvantages of hemodialysis. a. It is less similar to the physiology of natural kidney function than is peritoneal dialysis, predisposing the patient to the following: Hypotension due to rapid removal of intravascular volume leading to rapid fluid shifts from the extravascular space into cells. Hypo-osmolality due to solute removal. b. Requires vascular access. D. Peritoneal Dialysis 1. Process a. The peritoneum serves as the dialysis membrane. Dialysate fluid is infused into the peritoneal cavity, then fluids and solutes from the peritoneal capillaries diffuse into the dialysate fluid, which is drained from the abdomen. b. A hyperosmolar (high-glucose) solution is used, and water is removed from the blood via osmosis. 2. Frequency: dialysate fluid is drained and replaced every hour in acute peritoneal dialysis, but only once every 4 to 8 hours in CAPD. 3. Access a. With CAPD, dialysate is infused into the peritoneal fluid via an implanted catheter. b. A temporary catheter is used for acute peritoneal dialysis. 4. Advantages a. The patient can learn to perform dialysis on his or her own. b. It mimics the physiology of normal kidney function more closely than hemodialysis in that it is more continuous. 5. Disadvantages a. High glucose load may lead to hyperglycemia and hypertriglyceridemia. b. Peritonitis is a significant potential complication. c. The patients must be highly motivated to self-administer it. d. Cosmetic\u2014there is increased abdominal girth due to dialysate fluid. E. Limitations and Complications of Dialysis 1. Limitations\u2014dialysis does not replicate the kidney\u2019s synthetic functions. Therefore, dialysis patients are still prone to erythropoietin and vitamin D deficiency, with their associated complications. 2. Complications associated with hemodialysis. a. Hypotension\u2014may result in myocardial ischemia, fatigue, and so on. b. The relative hypo-osmolality of the ECF compared with the brain may result in nausea, vomiting, headache, and rarely, seizures or coma. c. \u201cFirst-use syndrome\u201d\u2014chest pain, back pain, and rarely, anaphylaxis may occur immediately after a patient uses a new dialysis machine. d. Hemolysis: often due to issues with dialysate solution e. Complications associated with anticoagulation\u2014hemorrhage, hematoma, etc. f. Infection of vascular access site\u2014may lead to sepsis. g. Hemodialysis-associated amyloidosis of \u03b22 -microglobulin in bones and joints, can lead to bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome. 3. Complications associated with peritoneal dialysis. a. Peritonitis, often accompanied by fever and abdominal pain\u2014usually can be treated with intraperitoneal antibiotics; cloudy peritoneal fluid is key sign. b. Abdominal/inguinal hernia\u2014increased risk due to elevated intra-abdominal pressures. c. Hyperglycemia\u2014especially with diabetic patients. d. Protein malnutrition.","title":"Dialysis"},{"location":"IM/Nephrology/Dialysis%20in%20Renal%20Failure.html#dialysis","text":"","title":"Dialysis"},{"location":"IM/Nephrology/Dialysis%20in%20Renal%20Failure.html#background","text":"There are three main forms of dialysis: Haemodialysis (HD) Haemofiltration Peritoneal dialysis (PD)","title":"Background"},{"location":"IM/Nephrology/Dialysis%20in%20Renal%20Failure.html#how-to-choose-dialysis","text":"Independent patients \u2192 allow maintained independence \u2192 peritoneal dialysis If potential issues with peritoneum or bowel, or high risk infection \u2192 haemodialysis If not independent \u2192 haemodialysis","title":"How to choose dialysis"},{"location":"IM/Nephrology/Dialysis%20in%20Renal%20Failure.html#indications-for-dialysis","text":"Acidosis Electrolyte abnormalities Intoxication Overload (fluid) Uremia A.

Tunneled catheters are placed under the skin which leads to a lower rate of infection. These catheters are often suitable for use up to 6 months. c. Arteriovenous fistula. Best form of permanent dialysis access. It requires vascular surgery to connect the radial or brachial artery to veins in the forearm. An audible bruit and palpable thrill (due to high flow) over the fistula indicates that it is patent. Absence of these findings is abnormal and is concerning for thrombosis of the vessel. d. An alternative to an arteriovenous fistula is an implantable graft\u2014typically made of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE). 4. Alternatives to traditional hemodialysis. a. Continuous arteriovenous hemodialysis (CAVHD) and continuous venovenous hemodialysis (CVVHD) are often used in hemodynamically unstable patients, such as ICU patients with AKI. This allows for closer control of electrolytes and fluid status. b. Lower flow rates of blood and dialysate enable dialysis to occur while minimizing rapid shifts in volume and osmolality which these patients may not be able to tolerate. c. They require highly efficient dialyzers to be effective. 5. Advantages of hemodialysis. a. It is more efficient than peritoneal dialysis. High flow rates and efficient dialyzers shorten the period of time required for dialysis. b. It can be initiated more quickly than peritoneal dialysis, using temporary vascular access in the emergent setting. 6. Disadvantages of hemodialysis. a. It is less similar to the physiology of natural kidney function than is peritoneal dialysis, predisposing the patient to the following: Hypotension due to rapid removal of intravascular volume leading to rapid fluid shifts from the extravascular space into cells. Hypo-osmolality due to solute removal. b. Requires vascular access. D. Peritoneal Dialysis 1. Process a. The peritoneum serves as the dialysis membrane. Dialysate fluid is infused into the peritoneal cavity, then fluids and solutes from the peritoneal capillaries diffuse into the dialysate fluid, which is drained from the abdomen. b. A hyperosmolar (high-glucose) solution is used, and water is removed from the blood via osmosis. 2. Frequency: dialysate fluid is drained and replaced every hour in acute peritoneal dialysis, but only once every 4 to 8 hours in CAPD. 3. Access a. With CAPD, dialysate is infused into the peritoneal fluid via an implanted catheter. b. A temporary catheter is used for acute peritoneal dialysis. 4. Advantages a. The patient can learn to perform dialysis on his or her own. b. It mimics the physiology of normal kidney function more closely than hemodialysis in that it is more continuous. 5. Disadvantages a. High glucose load may lead to hyperglycemia and hypertriglyceridemia. b. Peritonitis is a significant potential complication. c. The patients must be highly motivated to self-administer it. d. Cosmetic\u2014there is increased abdominal girth due to dialysate fluid. E. Limitations and Complications of Dialysis 1. Limitations\u2014dialysis does not replicate the kidney\u2019s synthetic functions. Therefore, dialysis patients are still prone to erythropoietin and vitamin D deficiency, with their associated complications. 2. Complications associated with hemodialysis. a. Hypotension\u2014may result in myocardial ischemia, fatigue, and so on. b. The relative hypo-osmolality of the ECF compared with the brain may result in nausea, vomiting, headache, and rarely, seizures or coma. c. \u201cFirst-use syndrome\u201d\u2014chest pain, back pain, and rarely, anaphylaxis may occur immediately after a patient uses a new dialysis machine. d. Hemolysis: often due to issues with dialysate solution e. Complications associated with anticoagulation\u2014hemorrhage, hematoma, etc. f. Infection of vascular access site\u2014may lead to sepsis. g. Hemodialysis-associated amyloidosis of \u03b22 -microglobulin in bones and joints, can lead to bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome. 3. Complications associated with peritoneal dialysis. a. Peritonitis, often accompanied by fever and abdominal pain\u2014usually can be treated with intraperitoneal antibiotics; cloudy peritoneal fluid is key sign. b. Abdominal/inguinal hernia\u2014increased risk due to elevated intra-abdominal pressures. c. Hyperglycemia\u2014especially with diabetic patients. d. Protein malnutrition.","title":"Indications for dialysis"},{"location":"IM/Nephrology/Haemodialysis%20%28HD%29.html","text":"Haemodialysis (HD) Background Arteriovenous fistulas are direct connections between arteries and veins.

Early diagnosis is difficult in the young child (under 5 years) and in developmentally delayed children; many of these children have established peritonitis or an appendix abscess at presentation. Delays in the diagnosis of acute appendicitis in childhood is related in part to its variable symptomatology. For example, there may be relatively little abdominal pain, vomiting may be absent and diarrhoea may be a misleading feature. Nevertheless, the most important and consistent feature is localized abdominal pain. The pain may be intermittent and colicky initially, or situated in the epigastrium or periumbilical region, but soon shifts to the right iliac fossa. Constant pain that is worse with movement is the result of peritoneal irritation (\u2018peritonism\u2019). Vomiting occurs in the majority of children, and some may pass a loose stool. The temperature is usually normal or slightly raised, but occasionally may be in excess of 38 \u00b0C. Physical examination of the abdomen should be directed at showing that movement of adjacent peritoneal surfaces exacerbates the pain. The child's cooperation makes assessment easier, and repeated examination of the abdomen may be required to make the diagnosis. A child with appendicitis usually will exhibit tenderness and guarding localized to the right iliac fossa. Gentle palpation and percussion tenderness, performed while observing the child's face, will provide the most reliable evidence of abdominal tenderness and involuntary guarding. Rebound tenderness is an unreliable sign in children, and attempts to elicit the sign may cause unnecessary pain and destroy the child's confidence in the doctor. Rectal examination is required rarely and is primarily indicated if a pelvic appendix or pelvic collection is suspected. It should not be performed when examination of the ventral abdominal wall has already enabled a confident diagnosis of acute appendicitis to be made. Bowel sounds may be normal or reduced and contribute little to the diagnosis. Peritonitis should be suspected when the child is acutely ill with abdominal pain and fever and is reluctant to move. On examination, there will be generalized abdominal tenderness and guarding. Clinical example Mark, a 10-year-old boy, had 36 hours of constant lower abdominal pain, which steadily became more severe. He vomited once initially, and was \u2018off his food\u2019.

Early diagnosis is difficult in the young child (under 5 years) and in developmentally delayed children; many of these children have established peritonitis or an appendix abscess at presentation. Delays in the diagnosis of acute appendicitis in childhood is related in part to its variable symptomatology. For example, there may be relatively little abdominal pain, vomiting may be absent and diarrhoea may be a misleading feature. Nevertheless, the most important and consistent feature is localized abdominal pain. The pain may be intermittent and colicky initially, or situated in the epigastrium or periumbilical region, but soon shifts to the right iliac fossa. Constant pain that is worse with movement is the result of peritoneal irritation (\u2018peritonism\u2019). Vomiting occurs in the majority of children, and some may pass a loose stool. The temperature is usually normal or slightly raised, but occasionally may be in excess of 38 \u00b0C. Physical examination of the abdomen should be directed at showing that movement of adjacent peritoneal surfaces exacerbates the pain. The child's cooperation makes assessment easier, and repeated examination of the abdomen may be required to make the diagnosis. A child with appendicitis usually will exhibit tenderness and guarding localized to the right iliac fossa. Gentle palpation and percussion tenderness, performed while observing the child's face, will provide the most reliable evidence of abdominal tenderness and involuntary guarding. Rebound tenderness is an unreliable sign in children, and attempts to elicit the sign may cause unnecessary pain and destroy the child's confidence in the doctor. Rectal examination is required rarely and is primarily indicated if a pelvic appendix or pelvic collection is suspected. It should not be performed when examination of the ventral abdominal wall has already enabled a confident diagnosis of acute appendicitis to be made. Bowel sounds may be normal or reduced and contribute little to the diagnosis. Peritonitis should be suspected when the child is acutely ill with abdominal pain and fever and is reluctant to move. On examination, there will be generalized abdominal tenderness and guarding. Clinical example Mark, a 10-year-old boy, had 36 hours of constant lower abdominal pain, which steadily became more severe. He vomited once initially, and was \u2018off his food\u2019. Movement made the pain worse. On examination, he was afebrile but appeared flushed. He was tender to gentle palpation in the right iliac fossa and had percussion tenderness in the same region. The urine contained a few white and red cells but no bacteria. No other investigation was performed.

It can occur at any age but is most likely in the infant between 3 and 18 months who suddenly develops screaming attacks of pain with vomiting. During each episode of pain the infant becomes pale and may draw up the legs. The spasms of pain tend to last for 2\u20133 minutes and occur at intervals of about 10\u201320 minutes, although after a while the pain becomes more persistent. Vomiting is an early symptom. The passage of a few loose stools early on represents evacuation of the bowel distal to the obstruction. The small volume and limited duration of loose stools in intussusception helps differentiate it from acute gastroenteritis. Congestion of the intussusceptum may lead to the passage of blood-stained or \u2018redcurrant jelly\u2019 stools. Many infants with intussusception present with little more than pallor, lethargy and vomiting, and may have little evidence of abdominal pain. Should these symptoms be ignored, the infant may progress to develop signs of septicaemia or shock. The infant with intussusception looks pale, lethargic, anxious and unwell. A vague mass may be felt in the right or left upper quadrants of the abdomen but, once abdominal distension has developed, the mass becomes obscure and difficult to palpate. The apex of the intussusceptum may be palpable on rectal examination in a few, and the examining glove may be blood-stained. A plain X-ray of the abdomen will often be normal but may show an unusual bowel gas distribution or features of bowel obstruction. Ultrasound examination may be helpful in making the diagnosis. Where intussusception is suspected clinically or confirmed on ultrasonography, a gas or barium enema must be performed (unless the child has peritonitis). The enema will demonstrate the position of the apex of the intussusception .

If gas enema facilities are not available, a barium enema under continuous fluoroscopic control is a less effective but satisfactory alternative. Peritonitis and septicaemia, which suggest the presence of dead bowel, are the only contraindications to attempted enema reduction. A dehydrated child should have intravenous fluid resuscitation and be wrapped in warm blankets before commencing an enema reduction. The success of enema reduction is recognized when there is sudden or rapid flow of gas or barium into the ileum. If partial reduction is achieved, and the child remains in good clinical condition, a further enema should be attempted after several hours (so called \u2018delayed repeat enema\u2019), and in about half of these patients it will be successful. Recurrence of intussusception occurs in about 9% of children after enema reduction, usually within days. Surgery is reserved for: those in whom enema reduction has failed those who have clinical evidence of necrotic bowel, such as peritonitis and septicaemia those in whom there is evidence of pathological lesions at the lead point.

Within 12 hours he started passing frequent, loose motions. Associated with this he appeared to have bouts of abdominal pain. On the second day the vomiting stopped but the diarrhoea persisted at a rate of more than eight stools per day. On presentation to the emergency department, Tim's weight was 13.6 kg, compared with 14.5 kg 3 weeks previously. He was clinically assessed to be 5\u20138% dehydrated and was treated with an oral rehydration solution via a nasogastric tube. A provisional diagnosis of acute gastroenteritis was made. His temperature gradually settled over 24 hours and oral feeds were introduced once rehydration was complete. His stools returned to their normal pattern after 5 days. Rapid stool testing for rotavirus antigen was positive.","title":"Intussusception"},{"location":"IM/Paediatric%20Medicine/GIT/Intussusception.html#intussusception","text":"In intussusception, the distal ileum (the intussusceptum) telescopes into adjoining distal bowel (the intussuscipiens), resulting in intestinal obstruction.

The vast majority of pediatric patients with SBS have undergone neonatal surgical resection of intestine. The most common etiologies in children are necrotizing enterocolitis (45%); intestinal atresias (23%); gastroschisis Hay_Ch21_p0626-0668.indd 638 20/03/18 12:07 PM GASTROINTESTINAL TRACT 639 (15%); volvulus (15%); and, less commonly, congenital short bowel, long-segment Hirschsprung disease, and ischemic bowel. In many instances, infants with SBS require PN in order to provide adequate caloric, fluid, and electrolyte delivery in the setting of insufficient intestinal absorptive function. The requirement of supplemental PN for more than 2\u20133 months in the setting of SBS or any other underlying disorder qualifies the diagnosis of intestinal failure (IF). The goal in management of the patient with SBS is to promote growth and adaptation of the intestine such that adequate nutrition can be delivered and absorbed enterally. Many factors, including patient\u2019s gestational age, postsurgical anatomy (including residual small bowel length and presence of ileocecal valve and/or colon), presence of small bowel bacterial overgrowth, and underlying surgical disease, influence the process and likelihood of bowel adaptation and achievement of enteral autonomy. No specific anatomic bowel length measurements offer 100% certainty in predicting clinical outcomes in SBS. \u00bb Symptoms & Signs Typical symptoms for the patient with SBS are related to their underlying malabsorptive state, including diarrhea, dehydration, electrolyte or micronutrient deficiency states, and growth failure. Patients with SBS are also at risk for small bowel obstruction, bowel dilation and dysmotility (with secondary small bowel bacterial overgrowth), hepatobiliary disorders including cholelithiasis, nephrolithiasis due to calcium oxalate stones, oral feeding challenges, and GI mucosal inflammatory problems including noninfectious colitis and anastomotic ulcerations. For patients with IF, complications related to underlying PN therapy are common and can be life threatening. PN-associated liver disease (PNALD) is a progressive cholestatic liver injury that occurs in pediatric patients on PN and may progress to end-stage liver disease in 10% of affected patients. Recurrent catheterrelated bloodstream infections are relatively common in pediatric patients with SBS and IF. Other complicationrelated central venous catheters including occlusions may require intervention. \u00bb Treatment & Prognosis Goal in management of SBS is to promote growth and adaptation while minimizing and/or treating complications of the underlying intestinal disorder or PN therapy. Intestinal rehabilitation for the child with SBS and IF refers to the multidisciplinary team approach to individual patient care, involving gastroenterology, nutrition, and surgery, and has been shown to improve outcomes. Enteral nutrition should be catered to favor absorption, commonly requiring continuous delivery of an elemental formula through a gastrostomy tube. Commonly prescribed pharmacologic adjuncts include acid suppressive therapy, antimotility and antidiarrheal agents, and antibiotics for the treatment of small bowel bacterial overgrowth. Emerging therapies targeted to promote bowel adaptation include glucagon-like peptide 2 analogues, which show promise in potentially increasing absorption and bowel adaptation in ongoing trials. Management for the patient with SBS and IF should include strategies to manage or prevent complications related to PN therapy, including infection and liver disease. Antimicrobial lock solutions distilled into central venous catheters using either ethanol or antibiotics may have a role in reducing infection rates. Compelling evidence over the past several years suggests that modification of parenteral lipid solution, either through reduction in dose of soy-based intralipid or replacement with a third-generation lipid solution (Omegaven or SMOF lipid), improves outcomes associated with PNALD in pediatric patients. Autologous bowel reconstructive surgery (bowel lengthening) should be considered in a patient who is failing to advance enterally and has anatomy amendable to surgical intervention, typically with regards to adequate bowel dilation. Both the serial transverse enteroplasty (STEP) procedure and longitudinal intestinal lengthening and tailoring (Bianchi) procedure have been successful in allowing weaning from TPN in up to 50% of patients in reported series. In recent years, the STEP procedure has gained favor as being potentially less technically demanding and repeatable, if the bowel dilates sufficiently after the initial procedure. When medical, nutritional, and surgical managements fail, intestinal transplantation may be considered for a child with refractory and life-threatening complications of IF.

Neonates and young infants have long omega-shaped epiglottis horizontally positioned high in the pharynx very near to the soft palate than in older children and adults + absence of paranasal sinuses, this causes less resistance to airflow in the nasal passages than in the oral route. Trachea in preterm and term infants is short and narrow and more compliant than in older children and adults because of the presence of immature cartilages. Neonates, especially premature ones, have fewer alveoli - lack interalveolar communications and remain at risk of collapse and may produce atelectasis in dependent areas of the lung. In young children, intercostal muscles are poorly developed and less effective as the accessory muscles of respiration. Ribs are horizontally aligned from the vertebral column and cannot increase the cross-sectional area of the thorax during inspiration , unlike older children and adults. inspiration occurs almost entirely because of diaphragmatic descent and the diaphragm bears all the workload of breathing in neonates and infants . To reduce diaphragmatic workload and maintain minute ventilation, these children then breathe rapidly with smaller tidal volumes .

Neonates and young infants have long omega-shaped epiglottis horizontally positioned high in the pharynx very near to the soft palate than in older children and adults + absence of paranasal sinuses, this causes less resistance to airflow in the nasal passages than in the oral route. Trachea in preterm and term infants is short and narrow and more compliant than in older children and adults because of the presence of immature cartilages. Neonates, especially premature ones, have fewer alveoli - lack interalveolar communications and remain at risk of collapse and may produce atelectasis in dependent areas of the lung. In young children, intercostal muscles are poorly developed and less effective as the accessory muscles of respiration. Ribs are horizontally aligned from the vertebral column and cannot increase the cross-sectional area of the thorax during inspiration , unlike older children and adults. inspiration occurs almost entirely because of diaphragmatic descent and the diaphragm bears all the workload of breathing in neonates and infants . To reduce diaphragmatic workload and maintain minute ventilation, these children then breathe rapidly with smaller tidal volumes .

Food allergy Food allergy in childhood is common, affecting 6\u20138% of children aged <3y. The commonest food allergies in early childhood are milk and egg. One to 3% of young children have cow\u2019s milk allergy. In later childhood, allergies to peanuts and tree nuts predominate. Other common allergens are fish, shellfish, wheat, and soy. Food allergy versus food intolerance Food intolerance is a non-immunologically mediated adverse reaction to food. It includes: **** Enzyme deficiencies, e.g. lactase deficiency. **** Pharmacological, e.g. tachycardias in heavy tea/coffee drinkers due to caffeine. **** Sensitivity to vasoactive amines in food, causing localized reactions such as lip swelling, e.g. cured meats, cheeses, fish, ripe bananas, oranges, tomatoes, strawberries. **** Toxin-mediated, e.g. scrombroid poisoning (histamine from spoilt fish), food poisoning. **** Chemical effects (gustatory rhinitis with hot/spicy foods). **** Irritant reactions. **** Infectious syndromes, e.g. food poisoning or acute urticaria with viral illness. Taking a food allergy history Careful history taking is important in a diagnosis of allergic disease, because it helps to differentiate allergic from non-allergic reactions, to identify potential triggers, and to direct investigations. **** Presenting symptoms: focus on gut, skin, and respiratory systems to differentiate IgE from non-IgE-mediated reactions (see Table 13.1 ). **** Timing of the reaction from ingestion. **** Previous exposure to the allergen and severity of reactions. **** Detailed feeding history, including breastfed/bottle-fed; weaning; foods avoided and why. **** Exposure to other common allergens (see Table 13.2 ): if they are being consuming regularly, there is no need to test for those allergens. **** Whether the reaction was preceded by exercise, viral illness, or alcohol consumption (as these can lower the threshold for reaction). **** History of other atopic diseases, including infantile eczema, asthma, and allergic rhinitis. **** Family history of atopy.

Emily is upset with this news. How did she get this, Mark was fine when they had sex? Viral shedding can occur in the absence of symptoms or vesicles Genital herpes can be secondary to HSV-1 or HSV-2 What is the recommended treatment and what advice do you need to give Emily now? Valaciclovir 500mg PO bd for 5-10 days (may require longer in initial episode) Simple analgesia, saline baths, topical lignocaine may help for symptoms Condom use regardless of the presence or absence of symptoms with partners Case 2: JB Presenting medical complaint John Bloom is a 24 year old man who comes to see you for the first time.

His microcytosis is mild and is of an appropriate severity given the degree of anaemia. The presence of a more severe microcytosis with a lesser degree of anaemia may lead one to suspect thalassaemia. The thromboycytosis is a common finding in patients with iron deficiency and is reactive in nature. \u2022What further testing is indicated? \u2022Iron studies are indicated to assess for iron deficiency. The presence of thalassaemia trait cannot be ruled out without further testing or without assessing response to iron therapy if iron studies indicate an iron deficiency. \u2022Bao had iron studies, liver function tests and CRP performed. His LFTs and CRP were normal. Interpret the results of his iron studies. \u2022What are the most common causes of iron deficiency anaemia? \u2022Gastrointestinal bleeding is the most common cause in Bao\u2019s age group. The most common sites are: upper GIT- oesophageal ulceration, malignancy, haemorrhoids, colorectal neoplasia, diverticular disease, angiodysplasia, Meckel diverticulum, coeliac disease. \u2022History should focus on- GI blood loss or melaena, weight loss, alcohol use, reflux symptoms, family history of GI cancer. \u2022What further investigations are required for Bao? \u2022Regardless of clinical findings that point to a specific cause for iron loss, a patient requires upper and lower GP endoscopies to exclude GI causes for blood loss, particularly malignancy. Referral to a gastroenterologist for these procedures is indicated. Case 2 \u2022The patient has a marked macrocytic anaemia with reticulocytopenia, thrombocytopaenia and mild leucopaenia. Neutrophil hypersegmentation is associated with a number of aetiologies, the most common being megaloblastic anaemia. \u2022Clinically she has developed a peripheral neuropathy (loss of distal proprioception and vibration sense loss, loss of sense of light touch). \u2022What are the causes of this blood picture? \u2022Macrocytic anaemia is most commonly associated with folate or B12 deficiency (megaloblastic anaemia). Myelodysplasia is a cause of macrocytic anaemia and pancytopaenia seen in the older population. Macrocytic anaemia may also be seen in patients with excessive alcohol intake, liver disease or hypothyroidism. It is also a common finding in patients taking antimetabolite meds such as methotrexate, certain antibiotics and antiretrovirals. \u2022Neutrophil hypersegmentation accompanies megaloblastic anaemia and therefore may occur with folate or B12 deficiency or the drugs above. \u2022Macrocytosis is also a feature of the myelodysplastic syndromes. This may also be accompanied by neutropaenia or thrombocytopaenia. \u2022Marked macrocytosis (>130fL) as seen in Helen\u2019s case usually indicates B12 or folate deficiency \u2022This results from: inadequate intake, poor absorption, or excessive utilisation (particularly for folate) \u2022Animal products contain B12, whereas green vegetables contain folate \u2022B12 requires an adequate acid environment in the stomach as well as secretion of intrinsic factor and a function ileum for successful absorption. Folate is absorbed in the jejumum. Before treating folate deficiency it is important to exclude concomitant B12 deficiency \u2022What further tests are required? \u2022B12 and folate levels \u2022B12 ref ranges vary between labs, and with repeat samples therefore careful interpretation required \u2022Serum folate a measure of short term folate balance, Red cell folate may better reflect long term stores, however not as reproducible as serum folate. \u2022This patient has multiple potential causes for having a B12 deficiency. She may have gastritis from her excessive ETOH intake (which may be more than she is stating). She has been on a Proton Pump inhibitor for a long time, which can block B12 absorption. Her diet may be inadequate if she following an overly restrictive diet (such as vegan). \u2022Students should also consider pernicious anaemia but it is beyond the scope of this tutorial to go into the detail of pernicious anaemia. It is appropriate to check for intrinsic factor antibody if her B12 level is low as this is highly specific (ie virtually diagnostic) of pernicious anaemia, but has low sensitivity. Equivocal cases should be discussed with a gastroenterologist. \u2022Folate deficiency may be caused by poor dietary intake and alcoholism, coeliac disease or inflammatory bowel disease or the other causes previously mentioned on slide 19. Case 3 What differential diagnosis should you consider at this stage? Infection- Hep B or C, drugs, alcohol, autoimmune chronic active hepatitis, haemochromatosis Symptoms and family history suggest haemochromatosis which can cause lethargy and arthralgia The disorder can cause iron deposition in the liver (cirrhosis), skin (hyperpigmentation), pituitary (hypogonadism), pancreas (diabetes), joints (arthropathy), heart (cardiomyopathy) What further investigations should you do? Iron studies, fasting blood glucose, Hepatitis virus serology, abdo USS, coagulation studies \u2022What is your diagnosis? \u2022Hereditary haemochromatosis \u2022What further investigations should be done? \u2022Other family members should be screened \u2022Haemochromatosis gene testing: C282Y and H63D \u2022Liver biopsy- because of abnormal LFTs, ferritin >1000 and hepatomegaly, OR MRI to evaluate liver status \u2022Management may include referral to a gastroenterologist, will need weekly venesection until serum iron levels return to normal (may take 2-3 years).

She has been in Australia for 40 years and speaks English well. She previously worked as a teacher\u2019s aide in the local primary school. Maria lives with her son Joe and his wife in Wyoming and is usually independent with all her activities of daily living although Joe helps out with some more complicated financial transactions and has done so since his Dad passed away ten years ago. Maria\u2019s family bring her to the emergency department at Gosford Hospital as they were concerned to find that whilst having her morning cup of tea (around 8am) she appeared to develop some mild right facial weakness and they were having difficulty understanding what she was trying to say. She picked up her mug and promptly dropped it. Maria\u2019s family bring her to the emergency department at Gosford Hospital as they were concerned to find that whilst having her morning cup of tea (around 8am) she appeared to develop some mild right facial weakness and they were having difficulty understanding what she was trying to say. She picked up her mug and promptly dropped it. She was able to walk to the car so they brought her to the hospital ED themselves as they were only 5 minutes drive away. Questions (Part 1): Was it a smart idea to bring Maria into hospital by family car? What are the advantages of calling an ambulance? Manage deterioration Appropriate hospital BAT CALL - to call ahead so no delay on arrival How should she be triaged on arrival, what are the critical components of initial assessment? ABCDE Level of consciousness Airway security History When you ask they state that Maria seemed perfectly fine when she went to bed the night before and on first waking this morning. Importance of being OK first thing this am? We are now able to establish how long Maria has been off for This is important in determining the type of treatment she is eligible for She was not complaining of headache or feeling otherwise unwell. She has not had these type of symptoms previously and does not suffer from migraine. What are the primary differentials? Stroke/TIA, Migraine, epilepsy, hypoglycaemia Anything else in history which may be of importance? Rule out stroke mimics - migraine, epilepsy, hypoglycaemia Has she had similar symptoms in the past? Diabetes and blood sugars? Complains of headache (migraine) Known AF or risk factors for vascular disease? On anticoagulants (i.e. risk of haemorrhage)? However RECOGNISE that time is of the essence - a stroke call should be done by this point Past medical history Maria suffers from Type 2 diabetes mellitus She has well controlled hypertension and is overweight (BMI 28) She had a left total knee replacement two years ago without perioperative complications and is now independently mobile without aids She has not had any need for hospitalisation since the time of the knee replacement Medications Metformin 500mg bd, Amlodipine 5mg daily, Paracetamol 1g qid prn, What classes of medications are the first two listed? Metformin is a biguanide - diabetic medication Amlodipine is a calcium channel blocker (dihydropyridine) What is an example of a non-dihydropyridine (Verapamil, diltiazem) What is the difference in cardiovascular effect between DHP and non-DHP? (non-DHPs have greater negative inotropic effect) Examination You need to examine Maria\u2019s speech to see what it is the family are concerned about. What types of speech disturbance will you be looking for? What is the difference between dysphasia, dysarthria and dysphonia? Dysphasia Expressive aphasia Receptive aphasia Dysarthria Dysphonia Describe a system for examination of speech In the setting of possible stroke the NIH stroke scale would be performed and this includes screening tests for dysphasia (obeys commands-open close eyes/hands, describe the picture below and name the objects in the other picture) and dysarthria (read the words on the sheet). The students can be asked to think about the limitations here (how good is her English? Can she read? What would they do of the answer to either is no?) Ask a family member to help Involve a translator Screening = Ask something hard and if the patient can do it then they\u2019re probably OK Reception: Point to the ceiling after you point to the floor Repetition: Repeat after me: \u201cNo ifs ands or buts\u201d, \u201chippopotamus\u201d Language function is often clear after taking a history, but if not Naming: Collar, sleeve, cuff; knuckles Fluent speech: History or a task such as describing a picture, reading a paragraph What type of lesion (site central/peripheral) would be associated each type of speech disturbance? The areas associated with language and which are affected in dysphasia are the posterior temporal lobe (Wernicke\u2019s, language comprehension), posterior inferior frontal lobe (Broca\u2019s area, production of meaningful language) Dysarthria can result from both UMN and LMN lesions anywhere from motor cortex, cranial nerves, cerebellum or muscles involved in speech, Actually by the time you finish getting the brief description from the family (about 5 minutes) and start to examine Maria you find her speech has returned to normal. The family are a little surprised but relieved. You examine the rest of her neurological system and find that there are no signs of facial or limb weakness and she even gets up out of the bed and walks quite normally What else do you need to examine? Other focal neurological signs including weakness including motor drift, hemi-sensory loss, neglect, co-ordination, visual fields.

What other neurological functions have you examined? The remainder of the neurological examination including the cranial nerves is normal. BP is 145/90 without a postural drop Her heart rate is 66 bpm and regular There are no cardiac murmurs or Carotid Bruit and she is afebrile There are no abnormalities on examination of the abdomen - What is the most likely working diagnosis at this point? - TIA - Are there any important differentials we need to exclude? - Migraine, Seizure, Hypoglycaemia, Stroke - Syncope/severe hypotension (but no dizziness) - What investigations would you like to perform? - Immediate: CTB and CT Arch to CoW - should be done for the stroke workup - ECG done for exclusion of AF or silent ischemia - Bloods: FBC, EUC, CMP (electrolyte, anemia, infection) - EUC needed (or a VBG can be done) to find SCr - needed if you order a CT Arch to CoW - BSL (also found on VBG) to exclude hypoglycaemia Investigations ECG normal, BSL normal, FBC EUC CMP LFT all normal, CTB: Multitrauma cases taking up scanners What will we do now? 1) send her home to see her GP in a couple of days 2) ask her to come to the next neurology clinic 3) admit her to the general ward overnight 4) admit her to the stroke unit for observation and further investigations What is her estimated risk of stroke in the next 2 days ABCD2 score - Her age >60, BP>140, unilateral weakness at the time of the episode and diabetes all increase the risk. The duration of symptoms is the other factor and that is unclear here. (The use of this score to define a group of lower risk patients who can have their investigations less urgently is now discouraged however we do know that more of these risk factors correlates to a higher risk of recurrent episodes as does the presence of recurrent episodes on history) Her ABCD2 score is at least 5 which puts her risk of stroke in the next 2 days between 4.1 and 8.1% - Maria is seen by the stroke team in ED, given some chewable aspirin immediately and transferred to the stroke unit - hand over to the stroke team - Students should use an ISBAR format to summarise their handover information. - Identify: Hi I am \u2026\u2026and I have been looking after Maria this morning as the JMO in ED - Situation: Maria has presented with acute onset of a speech deficit with facial and possible arm weakness noted by her family at 8 am this morning. This had fully resolved by the time she was assessed here in ED. - Background: Maria is normally very independent functionally but she is diabetic and being treated for hypertension - Assessment : Neuro exam, BP, BSL, ECG. She is waiting for a scan - Recommendation: The CT scanner is currently not free. She needs to have her imaging as soon as the scanner is available and should be admitted to the stroke unit if you are in agreement. Management Maria is seen by the stroke team in ED, given some chewable aspirin immediately and transferred to the stroke unit What happens in the stroke unit? She is also started on a statin and placed on regular BP and continuous cardiac monitoring She is booked for a CT angiogram (Arch to Circle of Willis), echocardiograph Holter monitor booked Bloods for tomorrow ordered, including FBC, EUC, CMP, LFT, HbA1c, fasting lipids Around 30 mins later (9am) the RN notes that her rhythm appears abnormal on the telemetry and organises a repeat ECG Her blood pressure and other observations have remained normal throughout Interpret and report on this ECG Rate: irregularly irregular, 72 BPM Rhythm: Irregularly irregular with no obvious p-waves Axis: Left-deviated axis P-wave absent PR interval NAD QRS complex < 0.12s, normal narrow complex ST segment - ?high takeoff point V2/V3 potentially elevated but does not reach STEMI criteria QT-interval normal T-wave normal, inverted I, aVL, V6 Progress Maria is still waiting for further cerebral imaging when the RN does her regular observations at 9.20am and notes that Maria has developed a dense right sided hemiplegia and dysphasia The stroke registrar is called and the radiology department is asked to move the CT angiogram to the urgent queue. Maria\u2019s family are called to come back from the coffee shop downstairs. What might be happening now? Re-infarct in same territory, likely ischemic in origin (Cardioembolic) Likely middle cerebral artery based on signs (Left) Still needs CT-brain non-con but now more urgent mechanisms of ischemic stroke: large vessel disease, cardioembolic, small vessel, venous infarction, vasculopathies Opacification of left MCA The CT excludes haemorrhage and the angiogram shows clot in the M1 segment of the left middle cerebral artery Intravenous thrombolysis is administered at 9.50am within 3 hours of the onset of symptoms Further questions Explain the mechanism of action of thrombolytic therapy and potential adverse reactions rtPA, streptokinin are both fibrinolytics What are the major contraindications and how long after the onset of symptoms is therapy indicated in acute stroke? ABSOLUTE contraindications Brain bleed: Recent haemorrhage stroke, head trauma, metastases/tumours Body bleed: ?aortic dissection, recent surgery in last 3 months Fibrinolytics In practice, relative contraindication is also SBP < 180mmHg Needs to be brought down before giving it Indication for thrombolysis is that it must be given within 4.5 hours of symptom onset - Is there any other treatment that could be used in this patient? ECR is performed for proximal/larger lesions (in M1 and M2 vessels typically) - time to treatment must be <24h for improved outcomes She is discussed with the interventional team at Royal North Shore and is accepted for transfer for consideration of endovascular clot retrieval Whilst in transit she has complete resolution of her symptoms and signs and does not undergo further treatment The echocardiogram is performed at RNSH to complete her diagnostic work-up and shows some mild atrial dilatation only. There are no further events or complications. What ongoing management needs to be considered prior to discharge? Speech path, PT, OT clearance Will patient be safe to go home? SW and ACAT? Anticoagulation for stroke prevention How do we decide which patients are suitable candidates for anticoagulation for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation? CHADS2-VASc score for non-valvular AF stroke risk Maria scores 7 - has stroke risk of > 10% per year Risk of bleeding on anticoagulation calculated using HAS-BLED Role play how they will speak to Maria and her family about the risk and benefit of anticoagulation. What agents are available for anticoagulation and what are their modes of action? COX inhibitor (NSAIDs) GPIIb-IIIa receptor antagonist P2Y12 receptor antagonist How might we decide between the available agents? Valvular AF - Warfarin Severe kidney injury - Warfarin Non-valvular AF - Apixaban/DOACs If no AF - DAPT Hypertension Presentation Hana is the 24 year old Malaysian woman you met in week 6. She returns to her rheumatologist (in his rooms at the local hospital) for follow up and is complaining of nausea, vomiting, severe headache, lethargy and swollen ankles Her blood pressure is 210/110 What might be the cause of this presentation? Cardiac? - Nil breathlessness, and fairly acute (does she have Hx of HF?) Renal - worsening of renal disease What else will the specialist be looking for on examination and what simple bedside test should be performed straight away if possible? Urinalysis / dipstick Examination She does have significant oedema to mid shins bilaterally. Her other observations are within normal limits The respiratory examination is normal as is the cardiac examination The abdomen is soft and non distended with no palpable organomegaly What else do we need to look for? What do we expect to see if oedema was due to a heart failure? RHF - hepatomegaly, raised JVP Nephrotic syndrome Liver failure decreased albumin, reduced platelet, coagulation factors, examination for ascites, gynaecomastia, spider naevi, etc. Investigations for HTN Secondary organ dysfunction Hypertensive encephalopathy? Stroke? Pulmonary oedema? Retina or papilloedema? Hypertensive emergency vs. urgency Emergency = end organ damage Other causes of secondary hypertension? What features would you expect to see? Renal artery stenosis Cushings Conn's syndrome Phaeochromocytoma Cotton wool spots (Retinal infarcts) in acute hypertensive retinopathy. Plan The urinalysis reveals moderate haematuria and 3+ proteinuria The rheumatologist calls the admitting officer at the local hospital and arranges urgent admission Why? concern of hypertensive emergency on background of lupus nephritis Want ED staff to be aware of patient for direct Renal admission Please hand over patient to renal team What are potential causes and complications of malignant hypertension? Stabilise BP, check for complications, monitor LOC and cardic status ECG and bloods to check renal function May need catherisation to establish an accurate output Labetalol probably most often used in emergency and can be given in acute renal failure Investigations Raised SCr to 320, reduced eGFR (though would like to know her baseline - ?AKI on CKD) Reduced serum albumin (though albumin decreases as an acute phase reactant) WCC elevated, neutrophilia mild anaemia (?CKD) Plt decreased Low bicarbonate - ?VBG for a metabolic acidosis Blood is also sent for ANA, anti-dsDNA antibodies and complement levels What are these tests used for? C3/C4 go down in lupus nephritis, indicator of active disease ANA must be positive in SLE - good sensitivity Anti-dsDNA are highly specific for SLE, correlate with disease activity in some patients The hypertension is managed and she has a renal consult the same day A decision is made to perform a renal biopsy Coagulation studies are normal before the procedure Diffuse proliferative lupus nephritis The biopsy image shows grade IV lupus nephritis which includes marked mesangial cellular proliferation and marked thickening of the glomerular capillary wall . All the glomeruli within this field are affected: marked mesangial hypercellularity and proliferation can be seen in this PAS stain. Students should be reminded that immunofluorescence and electron microscopy are also used to confirm the diagnosis. Management She is started on pulse methylprednisone and mycophenolate What parameters other than her creatinine will be important to monitor over the next few days and why? Monitor for worsening renal function (hyperkalemia, acidosis) Ongoing BP monitoring High dose steroid side effects - BSL, mood, BP","title":"Stroke and TIA"},{"location":"Teaching/Newcastle/Module%209%20-%20Focal%20Neurological%20Deficit%20and%20Speech%20Difficulty.html#stroke-and-tia","text":"Cerebrovascular disease Stroke syndromes","title":"Stroke and TIA"},{"location":"Teaching/Newcastle/Module%209%20-%20Focal%20Neurological%20Deficit%20and%20Speech%20Difficulty.html#presentation","text":"Maria is a 76 year old lady of Italian descent.

What types of speech disturbance will you be looking for? What is the difference between dysphasia, dysarthria and dysphonia? Dysphasia Expressive aphasia Receptive aphasia Dysarthria Dysphonia Describe a system for examination of speech In the setting of possible stroke the NIH stroke scale would be performed and this includes screening tests for dysphasia (obeys commands-open close eyes/hands, describe the picture below and name the objects in the other picture) and dysarthria (read the words on the sheet). The students can be asked to think about the limitations here (how good is her English? Can she read? What would they do of the answer to either is no?) Ask a family member to help Involve a translator Screening = Ask something hard and if the patient can do it then they\u2019re probably OK Reception: Point to the ceiling after you point to the floor Repetition: Repeat after me: \u201cNo ifs ands or buts\u201d, \u201chippopotamus\u201d Language function is often clear after taking a history, but if not Naming: Collar, sleeve, cuff; knuckles Fluent speech: History or a task such as describing a picture, reading a paragraph What type of lesion (site central/peripheral) would be associated each type of speech disturbance? The areas associated with language and which are affected in dysphasia are the posterior temporal lobe (Wernicke\u2019s, language comprehension), posterior inferior frontal lobe (Broca\u2019s area, production of meaningful language) Dysarthria can result from both UMN and LMN lesions anywhere from motor cortex, cranial nerves, cerebellum or muscles involved in speech, Actually by the time you finish getting the brief description from the family (about 5 minutes) and start to examine Maria you find her speech has returned to normal. The family are a little surprised but relieved. You examine the rest of her neurological system and find that there are no signs of facial or limb weakness and she even gets up out of the bed and walks quite normally What else do you need to examine?
