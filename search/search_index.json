It is the most common primary cardiac neoplasm. The majority of myxomas are sporadic, but autosomal-dominant transmission has been noted. Although benign, atrial myxomas can embolize, leading to metastatic disease, or can cause relative valvular dysfunction. Clinical features Prototypically present with fatigue, fever, syncope, palpitations, malaise, and a lowpitched diastolic murmur that changes character with changing body positions (diastolic plop). murmur will change depending on position Diagnosis Echocardiogram? CT? Treatment Surgical excision. Summary Cardiac myxomas are the most common type of primary tumor of the heart . They are usually benign and arise from primary connective tissue . Most cardiac myxomas arise sporadically; however, 10% are hereditary (following an autosomal dominant pattern). Even though they may develop in any chamber of the heart , most (\u223c 75 %) cardiac myxomas arise in the left atrium , usually from the interatrial septum , while the rest occur in the right atrium (ventricular myxomas are rare). Clinical features are primarily caused by obstruction of the blood flow through the heart and include dyspnea on exertion, palpitations, syncope , weight loss, or even sudden death. Rarely, life-threatening conditions (e.g., stroke ) may result from an embolization from the myxoma. Typical examination findings include abnormal heart sounds , such as a rumbling diastolic murmur over the apex or a characteristic \u201c tumor plop.\u201d The diagnosis is not easily established clinically because of the nonspecific nature of symptoms. Echocardiography is the diagnostic procedure of choice. Surgical resection of the tumor is the curative treatment of choice.

The creatinine may be normal despite a markedly reduced glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in the early stages of acute kidney injury (AKI) due to the time it takes for creatinine to accumulate in the body. This condition is also called acute renal failure (ARF). One consensus definition of AKI is called the RIFLE criteria. RISK: 1.5-fold increase in the serum creatinine or GFR decrease by 25% or urine output <0.5 mL/kg/hr for 6 hours. INJURY: Twofold increase in the serum creatinine or GFR decrease by 50% or urine output <0.5 mL/kg/hr for 12 hours. FAILURE: Threefold increase in the serum creatinine or GFR decrease by 75% or urine output of <0.5 mL/kg/hr for 24 hours, or anuria for 12 hours. LOSS: Complete loss of kidney function (i.e., requiring dialysis) for more than 4 weeks. ESRD: Complete loss of kidney function (i.e., requiring dialysis) for more than 3 months. Approach AKI may be nonoliguric, oliguric, or anuric. Severe AKI may occur without a reduction in urine output (nonoliguric AKI). General goals of therapy are reversing the initial insult to the kidney and/or supportive care as GFR recovers, as well as preventing fulminant kidney failure requiring temporary or permanent hemodialysis. Weight gain and edema are most common findings in patients with AKI. This is due to a positive water and sodium (Na+) balance. Characterized by azotemia (elevated BUN and Cr) Elevated BUN is also seen with catabolic drugs (e.g., steroids), GI/soft tissue bleeding (due to RBC digestion and re-absorption of urea), and dietary protein intake. Elevated Cr is also seen with increased muscle breakdown and various drugs. The baseline Cr level varies proportionately with muscle mass. Prognosis More than 80% of patients in whom AKI develops recover completely. However, prognosis varies widely depending on the severity of renal failure and other comorbidities. The older the patient and the more severe the insult, the lower is the likelihood of complete recovery. The most common cause of death is infection (75% of all deaths), followed by cardiorespiratory complications. Other nonfatal complications include chronic kidney injury and need for dialysis Life-threatening consequences volume overload hypoerkalaemia metabolic acidosis Risk factors: Diabetes, HTN, Elderly Approach Prerenal failure a. Most common cause of AKI; potentially reversible b. Etiology (decrease in systemic arterial blood volume or renal perfusion leading to renal ischemia)\u2014can complicate any disease that causes hypovolemia, low cardiac output, or systemic vasodilation Hypovolemia\u2014dehydration, excessive diuretic use, poor fluid intake, vomiting, diarrhea, burns, hemorrhage, CHF, cardiorenal syndrome Hypotension (systolic BP below 90 mm Hg), from sepsis, excessive, antihypertensive medications, bleeding, dehydration Renal arterial obstruction (kidney is hypoperfused despite elevated blood pressure) Cirrhosis, hepatorenal syndrome In patients with decreased renal perfusion, NSAIDs (constrict afferent arteriole), ACE inhibitors (cause efferent arteriole vasodilation), and cyclosporin can precipitate prerenal failure. Pathophysiology Renal blood flow decreases enough to lower the GFR, which leads to decreased clearance of metabolites (BUN, Cr, uremic toxins). Because the renal parenchyma is undamaged, tubular function (and therefore the concentrating ability) is preserved. Therefore, the kidney responds appropriately, conserving as much sodium and water as possible. This form of AKI is reversible on restoration of blood flow; but if hypoperfusion persists, ischemia results and can lead to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) Clinical features signs of volume depletion (dry mucous membranes, hypotension, tachycardia, decreased tissue turgor, oliguria/anuria) Diagnosis and Investigations Oliguria\u2014always found in prerenal failure (this is to preserve volume) Increased BUN-to-serum Cr ratio (>20:1 is the classic ratio)\u2014because kidney can reabsorb urea to increase sodium and water retention Increased urine osmolality (>500 mOsm/kg H2O)\u2014because the kidney is able to appropriately reabsorb water Decreased urine Na+ (<20 mEq/L with fractional excretion of sodium [FENa] <1%) because Na+ is avidly reabsorbed Increased urine\u2013plasma Cr ratio (>40:1)\u2014because much of the filtrate is reabsorbed (but not the creatinine) Bland urine sediment, indicating lack of significant cellular damage to glomeruli or tubules Intrinsic renal failure a. Kidney tissue (interstitium, glomeruli, tubules) is damaged such that glomerular filtration and tubular function are significantly impaired. Thus, kidneys are unable to concentrate urine effectively. b. Causes Tubular disease (ATN)\u2014can be caused by ischemia (most common cause), nephrotoxins (see Clinical Pearls 7-3 and 7-4) Glomerular disease (acute glomerulonephritis [GN])\u2014for example, Goodpasture syndrome, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, poststreptococcal GN, lupus Vascular disease\u2014for example, renal artery occlusion, TTP, HUS Interstitial disease\u2014for example, allergic interstitial nephritis, often due to a hypersensitivity reaction to medication c. Clinical features depend on the cause. Edema is usually present. Recovery may be possible but takes longer than in prerenal failure. d. Laboratory findings Decreased BUN-to-serum Cr ratio (<20:1, typically closer to 10:1 ratio) in comparison with prerenal failure. Both BUN and Cr levels are still elevated, but less urea is reabsorbed than in prerenal failure as kidney is no longer actively reabsorbing it. Increased urine Na+ (>40 mEq/L with FENa > 2% to 3%)\u2014because Na+ is poorly reabsorbed Decreased urine osmolality (<350 mOsm/kg H2O)\u2014because renal water reabsorption is impaired Decreased urine\u2013plasma Cr ratio (<20:1)\u2014because filtrate cannot be reabsorbed Postrenal failure a. Least common cause of AKI b. Obstruction of any segment of the urinary tract (with intact kidney) causes increased tubular pressure (urine produced cannot be excreted), which leads to decreased GFR. Blood supply and renal parenchyma are intact. Note that both kidneys must be obstructed (e.g., prostatic enlargement) for creatinine to rise. c. Renal function is restored if obstruction is relieved before the kidneys are damaged. d. Postrenal obstruction, if untreated, can lead to ATN. e. Causes Urethral obstruction secondary to enlarged prostate (BPH) is the most common cause Obstruction of solitary kidney Nephrolithiasis Obstructing neoplasm (bladder, cervix, prostate, and so on) Retroperitoneal fibrosis Ureteral obstruction is an uncommon cause because obstruction must be bilateral to cause renal failure. Diagnosis Blood tests EUC, FBC, LFT, Coags, ESR, CRP, CK Unclear cause - consider GMs Serum IG, electrophoresis, C3/C4, ASOT, Autoantibodies (ANA, ANCA, anti-dsDNA, anti-GBM) a. Elevation in BUN and Cr levels. Be aware that small changes in Cr may reflect a much more significant decrease in GFR. b. Electrolytes (retention of K+, PO4 3\u2212, drop in HCO3 \u2212 indicating acidosis, decrease in Na+ due to fluid retention) c. Albumin levels to monitor for nephrotic syndrome d. CBC with differential Urinalysis (Figure 7-2 and Table 7-2). a. A dipstick test positive for protein (3+, 4+) suggests intrinsic renal failure due to glomerular insult. b. Microscopic examination of the urine sediment: Crystals indicate presence of stones. Micro-organisms are seen in both infection and nonpathogenic colonization (differentiation made based on symptoms). Granular casts degeneration of cells and protein aggregates seen in ATN (\u201cmuddy brown\u201d casts) Hyaline casts are devoid of contents (seen in prerenal failure). RBC casts indicate glomerular disease. WBC casts indicate renal parenchymal inflammation. Fatty casts indicate nephrotic syndrome. Urine chemistry\u2014to distinguish between different forms of AKI. a. Urine Na+, Cr, and osmolality: Urine Na+ depends on dietary intake. b. FENa: collect urine and plasma electrolytes simultaneously = [(UNa )/(PNa )/(UCr)/PCr) \u00d7 100], where U = urine and P = plasma. Values below 1% suggest prerenal failure. Values above 2% to 3% suggest ATN. FENa is most useful if oliguria is present. If patient is on diuretics, UNa will be artificially elevated and fractional excretion of urea (FEUrea) must be used instead. c. Renal failure index 5 (uNa/[uCr/pCr]) \u00d7 100) Values below 1% suggest prerenal failure. Values above 1% suggest ATN. Urine culture and sensitivities\u2014if infection is suspected. Renal ultrasound. a. Primarily useful for evaluating kidney size and for excluding urinary tract obstruction (i.e., postrenal failure)\u2014presence of bilateral hydronephrosis or hydroureter b. Order for most patients with AKI\u2014unless the cause of the AKI is obvious and is not postrenal CT scan (abdomen and pelvis)\u2014may be helpful in some cases; usually done if renal ultrasound shows an abnormality such as hydronephrosis Renal biopsy\u2014useful occasionally if there is suspicion of acute GN or acute allergic interstitial nephritis Renal arteriography\u2014to evaluate for possible renal artery occlusion; should be performed only if specific therapy will make a difference CXR - pulmonary oedema ECG - hyperkalaemic changes Complications ECF volume expansion and resulting pulmonary edema\u2014treat with a diuretic (furosemide) Metabolic a. Hyperkalemia\u2014due to decreased excretion of K+ and the movement of potassium from ICF to ECF due to tissue destruction and acidosis b. Metabolic acidosis (with increased anion gap)\u2014due to decreased excretion of hydrogen ions; if severe (below 16 mEq/L), correct with sodium bicarbonate c. Hypocalcemia\u2014loss of ability to form active vitamin D and rapid development of PTH resistance d. Hyponatremia may occur if water intake is greater than body losses, or if a volume-depleted patient consumes excessive hypotonic solutions. (Hypernatremia may also be seen in hypovolemic states.) e. Hyperphosphatemia\u2014due to decreased clearance f. Hyperuricemia Uremia\u2014toxic end products of metabolism accumulate (especially from protein metabolism), leading to such complications as: a. Platelet dysfunction b. Immune dysfunction c. Pericarditis d. Encephalopathy Infection a. A common and serious complication of AKI (occurs in 50% to 60% of cases). The cause is probably multifactorial, but uremia itself is thought to impair immune function. b. Examples include pneumonia, UTI, wound infection, and sepsis. Treatment General measures (see also Table 7-3). a. Avoid medications that decrease renal blood flow (NSAIDs) and/or that are nephrotoxic (e.g., aminoglycosides, radiocontrast agents). b. Adjust medication dosages for level of renal function. c. Correct fluid imbalance. If volume depleted, give IV fluids. However, many patients with AKI are volume overloaded (especially if they are oliguric or anuric), so diuresis may be necessary IF SYMPTOMATIC The goal is to strike a balance between correcting volume deficits and avoiding volume overload (while maintaining adequate urine output). Remember that urine output is a reflection of renal blood flow (volume status) and GFR (kidney function). Monitor fluid balance by daily weight measurements (most accurate estimate) and intake\u2013output records. Be sure to take into account the patient\u2019s cardiac history when considering treatment options for fluid imbalances (i.e., do not give excessive fluid to a patient with CHF). d. Correct electrolyte disturbances if present. e. Optimize cardiac output. BP should be approximately 120 to 140/80 to 90. f. Order dialysis if symptomatic uremia, intractable acidemia, hyperkalemia, or volume overload develop. Indications for urgent dialysis often remembered by \u201cAEIOU\u201d mnemonic: Acidosis, Electrolytes, Intoxications (such as in overdoses), volume Overload, Uremia. Prerenal a. Treat the underlying disorder (such as hypovolemic or cardiogenic shock). b. Give fluids to maintain euvolemia and restore blood pressure\u2014do not give to patients with edema or ascites. May be necessary to stop antihypertensive medications. Remember that NS is often preferred unless acidemia is present (may worsen with hyperchloremia), in which case LR can be used. c. Eliminate any offending agents (ACE inhibitors, NSAIDs). d. If patient is unstable, Swan\u2013Ganz monitoring for accurate assessment of intravascular volume. Intrinsic a. Once ATN develops, therapy is supportive and renal function generally recovers. Eliminate the cause/offending agent. b. If oliguric, a trial of furosemide may help to increase urine flow. This improves fluid balance. Postrenal\u2014a bladder catheter may be inserted to decompress the urinary tract. Consider urology consultation. a. Be aware of the potential for post-obstructive diuresis and a rapid increase in urine output when obstruction is resolved, which may require IV fluid replacement.","title":"Acute kidney injury (AKI)"},{"location":"IM/Nephrology/Acute%20Kidney%20Injury.html#acute-kidney-injury-aki","text":"","title":"Acute kidney injury (AKI)"},{"location":"IM/Nephrology/Acute%20Kidney%20Injury.html#background","text":"","title":"Background"},{"location":"IM/Nephrology/Acute%20Kidney%20Injury.html#definition","text":"A rapid decline in renal function over hours or days, with an increase in serum creatinine level while the cutoff for rise in creatinine which qualifies as an \u201cinjury\u201d is controversial, an increase of as little as 0.3 mg/dL may have clinical relevance, while traditional definitions describe a relative increase of 50% or an absolute increase of 0.5 to 1.0 mg/dL).

FENa: collect urine and plasma electrolytes simultaneously = [(UNa )/(PNa )/(UCr)/PCr) \u00d7 100], where U = urine and P = plasma. Values below 1% suggest prerenal failure. Values above 2% to 3% suggest ATN. FENa is most useful if oliguria is present. If patient is on diuretics, UNa will be artificially elevated and fractional excretion of urea (FEUrea) must be used instead. c.

Avoid medications that decrease renal blood flow (NSAIDs) and/or that are nephrotoxic (e.g., aminoglycosides, radiocontrast agents). b. Adjust medication dosages for level of renal function. c. Correct fluid imbalance. If volume depleted, give IV fluids. However, many patients with AKI are volume overloaded (especially if they are oliguric or anuric), so diuresis may be necessary IF SYMPTOMATIC The goal is to strike a balance between correcting volume deficits and avoiding volume overload (while maintaining adequate urine output). Remember that urine output is a reflection of renal blood flow (volume status) and GFR (kidney function). Monitor fluid balance by daily weight measurements (most accurate estimate) and intake\u2013output records. Be sure to take into account the patient\u2019s cardiac history when considering treatment options for fluid imbalances (i.e., do not give excessive fluid to a patient with CHF). d. Correct electrolyte disturbances if present. e. Optimize cardiac output. BP should be approximately 120 to 140/80 to 90. f. Order dialysis if symptomatic uremia, intractable acidemia, hyperkalemia, or volume overload develop. Indications for urgent dialysis often remembered by \u201cAEIOU\u201d mnemonic: Acidosis, Electrolytes, Intoxications (such as in overdoses), volume Overload, Uremia. Prerenal a. Treat the underlying disorder (such as hypovolemic or cardiogenic shock). b. Give fluids to maintain euvolemia and restore blood pressure\u2014do not give to patients with edema or ascites. May be necessary to stop antihypertensive medications. Remember that NS is often preferred unless acidemia is present (may worsen with hyperchloremia), in which case LR can be used. c. Eliminate any offending agents (ACE inhibitors, NSAIDs). d. If patient is unstable, Swan\u2013Ganz monitoring for accurate assessment of intravascular volume. Intrinsic a. Once ATN develops, therapy is supportive and renal function generally recovers. Eliminate the cause/offending agent. b. If oliguric, a trial of furosemide may help to increase urine flow. This improves fluid balance. Postrenal\u2014a bladder catheter may be inserted to decompress the urinary tract. Consider urology consultation. a. Be aware of the potential for post-obstructive diuresis and a rapid increase in urine output when obstruction is resolved, which may require IV fluid replacement.","title":"Treatment"},{"location":"IM/Nephrology/Chronic%20Kidney%20Injury.html","text":"Chronic Kidney Disease A.

General Characteristics 1. Overview a. Dialysis is the artificial mechanism by which fluid and toxic solutes are removed from the circulation when the kidneys cannot do so sufficiently. b. In all forms of dialysis, the blood interfaces with an artificial solution resembling human plasma (called the dialysate), and diffusion of fluid and solutes occurs across a semipermeable membrane. c. The two major methods of dialyzing a patient are hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis (discussed below). d. The majority of dialysis patients in the United States receive hemodialysis at hospitals or dialysis centers, but more and more patients are opting for chronic ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). e. For patients with life-threatening complications of AKI, continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) can be used for constant renal support. This also avoids the larger fluid shifts of intermittent hemodialysis which hemodynamically unstable or heart failure patients may not be able to handle. B. When to Initiate Dialysis 1. General settings in which dialysis is considered. a. CKD\u2014dialysis serves as a bridge to renal transplantation or as a permanent treatment when the patient is not a transplantation candidate. b. AKI\u2014dialysis is often required as a temporary measure until the patient\u2019s renal function improves, often due to absolute indications (see Quick Hit). c. Overdose of medications or ingestions of substances cleared by the kidneys\u2014 some, but not all medications and toxins can be dialyzed (see Quick Hit). 2. Nonemergent indications a. Note: Cr and BUN levels are not absolute indications for dialysis, however some nephrologists will decide to initiate dialysis once a CKD patient\u2019s GFR drops below a certain value. b. Symptoms of uremia Nausea and vomiting Lethargy/deterioration in mental status, encephalopathy, seizures Pericarditis Emergent indications (usually in the setting of renal failure) a. Life-threatening manifestations of volume overload Pulmonary edema Hypertensive emergency refractory to antihypertensive agents b. Severe, refractory electrolyte disturbances, for example, hyperkalemia, hypermagnesemia c. Severe metabolic acidosis d. Drug toxicity/ingestions (particularly in patients with renal failure): methanol, ethylene glycol, lithium, aspirin C. Hemodialysis 1. Process a. The patient\u2019s blood is pumped by an artificial pump outside of the body through the dialyzer, which typically consists of fine capillary networks of semipermeable membranes. The dialysate flows on the outside of these networks, and fluid and solutes diffuse across the membrane. b. The patient\u2019s blood must be heparinized to prevent clotting in the dialyzer. 2. Frequency: Most hemodialysis patients require 3 to 5 hours of dialysis 3 days per week. 3. Access a. Use the central catheter placed using the Seldinger technique most often in the subclavian or jugular vein for temporary access. b. Tunneled catheters are placed under the skin which leads to a lower rate of infection. These catheters are often suitable for use up to 6 months. c. Arteriovenous fistula. Best form of permanent dialysis access. It requires vascular surgery to connect the radial or brachial artery to veins in the forearm. An audible bruit and palpable thrill (due to high flow) over the fistula indicates that it is patent. Absence of these findings is abnormal and is concerning for thrombosis of the vessel. d. An alternative to an arteriovenous fistula is an implantable graft\u2014typically made of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE). 4. Alternatives to traditional hemodialysis. a. Continuous arteriovenous hemodialysis (CAVHD) and continuous venovenous hemodialysis (CVVHD) are often used in hemodynamically unstable patients, such as ICU patients with AKI. This allows for closer control of electrolytes and fluid status. b. Lower flow rates of blood and dialysate enable dialysis to occur while minimizing rapid shifts in volume and osmolality which these patients may not be able to tolerate. c. They require highly efficient dialyzers to be effective. 5. Advantages of hemodialysis. a. It is more efficient than peritoneal dialysis. High flow rates and efficient dialyzers shorten the period of time required for dialysis. b. It can be initiated more quickly than peritoneal dialysis, using temporary vascular access in the emergent setting. 6. Disadvantages of hemodialysis. a. It is less similar to the physiology of natural kidney function than is peritoneal dialysis, predisposing the patient to the following: Hypotension due to rapid removal of intravascular volume leading to rapid fluid shifts from the extravascular space into cells. Hypo-osmolality due to solute removal. b. Requires vascular access. D. Peritoneal Dialysis 1. Process a. The peritoneum serves as the dialysis membrane. Dialysate fluid is infused into the peritoneal cavity, then fluids and solutes from the peritoneal capillaries diffuse into the dialysate fluid, which is drained from the abdomen. b. A hyperosmolar (high-glucose) solution is used, and water is removed from the blood via osmosis. 2. Frequency: dialysate fluid is drained and replaced every hour in acute peritoneal dialysis, but only once every 4 to 8 hours in CAPD. 3. Access a. With CAPD, dialysate is infused into the peritoneal fluid via an implanted catheter. b. A temporary catheter is used for acute peritoneal dialysis. 4. Advantages a. The patient can learn to perform dialysis on his or her own. b. It mimics the physiology of normal kidney function more closely than hemodialysis in that it is more continuous. 5. Disadvantages a. High glucose load may lead to hyperglycemia and hypertriglyceridemia. b. Peritonitis is a significant potential complication. c. The patients must be highly motivated to self-administer it. d. Cosmetic\u2014there is increased abdominal girth due to dialysate fluid. E. Limitations and Complications of Dialysis 1. Limitations\u2014dialysis does not replicate the kidney\u2019s synthetic functions. Therefore, dialysis patients are still prone to erythropoietin and vitamin D deficiency, with their associated complications. 2. Complications associated with hemodialysis. a. Hypotension\u2014may result in myocardial ischemia, fatigue, and so on. b. The relative hypo-osmolality of the ECF compared with the brain may result in nausea, vomiting, headache, and rarely, seizures or coma. c. \u201cFirst-use syndrome\u201d\u2014chest pain, back pain, and rarely, anaphylaxis may occur immediately after a patient uses a new dialysis machine. d. Hemolysis: often due to issues with dialysate solution e. Complications associated with anticoagulation\u2014hemorrhage, hematoma, etc. f. Infection of vascular access site\u2014may lead to sepsis. g. Hemodialysis-associated amyloidosis of \u03b22 -microglobulin in bones and joints, can lead to bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome. 3. Complications associated with peritoneal dialysis. a. Peritonitis, often accompanied by fever and abdominal pain\u2014usually can be treated with intraperitoneal antibiotics; cloudy peritoneal fluid is key sign. b. Abdominal/inguinal hernia\u2014increased risk due to elevated intra-abdominal pressures. c. Hyperglycemia\u2014especially with diabetic patients. d. Protein malnutrition.","title":"Dialysis"},{"location":"IM/Nephrology/Dialysis%20in%20Renal%20Failure.html#dialysis","text":"","title":"Dialysis"},{"location":"IM/Nephrology/Dialysis%20in%20Renal%20Failure.html#background","text":"There are three main forms of dialysis: Haemodialysis (HD) Haemofiltration Peritoneal dialysis (PD)","title":"Background"},{"location":"IM/Nephrology/Dialysis%20in%20Renal%20Failure.html#how-to-choose-dialysis","text":"Independent patients \u2192 allow maintained independence \u2192 peritoneal dialysis If potential issues with peritoneum or bowel, or high risk infection \u2192 haemodialysis If not independent \u2192 haemodialysis","title":"How to choose dialysis"},{"location":"IM/Nephrology/Dialysis%20in%20Renal%20Failure.html#indications-for-dialysis","text":"Acidosis Electrolyte abnormalities Intoxication Overload (fluid) Uremia A.

The dialysate flows on the outside of these networks, and fluid and solutes diffuse across the membrane. b. The patient\u2019s blood must be heparinized to prevent clotting in the dialyzer. 2. Frequency: Most hemodialysis patients require 3 to 5 hours of dialysis 3 days per week. 3. Access a. Use the central catheter placed using the Seldinger technique most often in the subclavian or jugular vein for temporary access. b. Tunneled catheters are placed under the skin which leads to a lower rate of infection. These catheters are often suitable for use up to 6 months. c. Arteriovenous fistula. Best form of permanent dialysis access. It requires vascular surgery to connect the radial or brachial artery to veins in the forearm. An audible bruit and palpable thrill (due to high flow) over the fistula indicates that it is patent. Absence of these findings is abnormal and is concerning for thrombosis of the vessel. d. An alternative to an arteriovenous fistula is an implantable graft\u2014typically made of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE). 4. Alternatives to traditional hemodialysis. a. Continuous arteriovenous hemodialysis (CAVHD) and continuous venovenous hemodialysis (CVVHD) are often used in hemodynamically unstable patients, such as ICU patients with AKI. This allows for closer control of electrolytes and fluid status. b. Lower flow rates of blood and dialysate enable dialysis to occur while minimizing rapid shifts in volume and osmolality which these patients may not be able to tolerate. c. They require highly efficient dialyzers to be effective. 5. Advantages of hemodialysis. a. It is more efficient than peritoneal dialysis. High flow rates and efficient dialyzers shorten the period of time required for dialysis. b. It can be initiated more quickly than peritoneal dialysis, using temporary vascular access in the emergent setting. 6. Disadvantages of hemodialysis. a. It is less similar to the physiology of natural kidney function than is peritoneal dialysis, predisposing the patient to the following: Hypotension due to rapid removal of intravascular volume leading to rapid fluid shifts from the extravascular space into cells. Hypo-osmolality due to solute removal. b. Requires vascular access. D. Peritoneal Dialysis 1. Process a. The peritoneum serves as the dialysis membrane. Dialysate fluid is infused into the peritoneal cavity, then fluids and solutes from the peritoneal capillaries diffuse into the dialysate fluid, which is drained from the abdomen. b. A hyperosmolar (high-glucose) solution is used, and water is removed from the blood via osmosis. 2. Frequency: dialysate fluid is drained and replaced every hour in acute peritoneal dialysis, but only once every 4 to 8 hours in CAPD. 3. Access a. With CAPD, dialysate is infused into the peritoneal fluid via an implanted catheter. b. A temporary catheter is used for acute peritoneal dialysis. 4. Advantages a. The patient can learn to perform dialysis on his or her own. b. It mimics the physiology of normal kidney function more closely than hemodialysis in that it is more continuous. 5. Disadvantages a. High glucose load may lead to hyperglycemia and hypertriglyceridemia. b. Peritonitis is a significant potential complication. c. The patients must be highly motivated to self-administer it. d. Cosmetic\u2014there is increased abdominal girth due to dialysate fluid. E. Limitations and Complications of Dialysis 1. Limitations\u2014dialysis does not replicate the kidney\u2019s synthetic functions. Therefore, dialysis patients are still prone to erythropoietin and vitamin D deficiency, with their associated complications. 2. Complications associated with hemodialysis. a. Hypotension\u2014may result in myocardial ischemia, fatigue, and so on. b. The relative hypo-osmolality of the ECF compared with the brain may result in nausea, vomiting, headache, and rarely, seizures or coma. c. \u201cFirst-use syndrome\u201d\u2014chest pain, back pain, and rarely, anaphylaxis may occur immediately after a patient uses a new dialysis machine. d. Hemolysis: often due to issues with dialysate solution e. Complications associated with anticoagulation\u2014hemorrhage, hematoma, etc. f. Infection of vascular access site\u2014may lead to sepsis. g. Hemodialysis-associated amyloidosis of \u03b22 -microglobulin in bones and joints, can lead to bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome. 3. Complications associated with peritoneal dialysis. a. Peritonitis, often accompanied by fever and abdominal pain\u2014usually can be treated with intraperitoneal antibiotics; cloudy peritoneal fluid is key sign. b. Abdominal/inguinal hernia\u2014increased risk due to elevated intra-abdominal pressures. c. Hyperglycemia\u2014especially with diabetic patients. d. Protein malnutrition.","title":"Indications for dialysis"},{"location":"IM/Nephrology/Haemodialysis%20%28HD%29.html","text":"Haemodialysis (HD) Background Arteriovenous fistulas are direct connections between arteries and veins.

Early diagnosis is difficult in the young child (under 5 years) and in developmentally delayed children; many of these children have established peritonitis or an appendix abscess at presentation. Delays in the diagnosis of acute appendicitis in childhood is related in part to its variable symptomatology. For example, there may be relatively little abdominal pain, vomiting may be absent and diarrhoea may be a misleading feature. Nevertheless, the most important and consistent feature is localized abdominal pain. The pain may be intermittent and colicky initially, or situated in the epigastrium or periumbilical region, but soon shifts to the right iliac fossa. Constant pain that is worse with movement is the result of peritoneal irritation (\u2018peritonism\u2019). Vomiting occurs in the majority of children, and some may pass a loose stool. The temperature is usually normal or slightly raised, but occasionally may be in excess of 38 \u00b0C. Physical examination of the abdomen should be directed at showing that movement of adjacent peritoneal surfaces exacerbates the pain. The child's cooperation makes assessment easier, and repeated examination of the abdomen may be required to make the diagnosis. A child with appendicitis usually will exhibit tenderness and guarding localized to the right iliac fossa. Gentle palpation and percussion tenderness, performed while observing the child's face, will provide the most reliable evidence of abdominal tenderness and involuntary guarding. Rebound tenderness is an unreliable sign in children, and attempts to elicit the sign may cause unnecessary pain and destroy the child's confidence in the doctor. Rectal examination is required rarely and is primarily indicated if a pelvic appendix or pelvic collection is suspected. It should not be performed when examination of the ventral abdominal wall has already enabled a confident diagnosis of acute appendicitis to be made. Bowel sounds may be normal or reduced and contribute little to the diagnosis. Peritonitis should be suspected when the child is acutely ill with abdominal pain and fever and is reluctant to move. On examination, there will be generalized abdominal tenderness and guarding. Clinical example Mark, a 10-year-old boy, had 36 hours of constant lower abdominal pain, which steadily became more severe. He vomited once initially, and was \u2018off his food\u2019. Movement made the pain worse. On examination, he was afebrile but appeared flushed. He was tender to gentle palpation in the right iliac fossa and had percussion tenderness in the same region. The urine contained a few white and red cells but no bacteria. No other investigation was performed. At laparoscopy an acutely inflamed appendix was removed.","title":"Appendicitis (Paediatrics)"},{"location":"IM/Paediatric%20Medicine/GIT/Appendicitis%20%28Paediatrics%29.html#general-features","text":"Most common cause of abdominal pain in children Age \u2013 median 8-9yrs : pain before vomiting and fever is uncommon \u2013 beware preschool child and fit teenager 50% <5 will present with advanced \u2013 perforated/mass Acute onset abdo pain Infection/faecolith \u2192 Transmural inflammation \u2192perforation","title":"General features"},{"location":"IM/Paediatric%20Medicine/GIT/Appendicitis%20%28Paediatrics%29.html#clinical-features","text":"Intermittent periumbilical pain (appendicular midgut colic) - 24h \u2192 migrates to RIF - 36-48h (peritonieal inflammation) Fevers (not high grade) anorexia Pain changing over 12 hours of onset initially no-few vomiting 48h - risk of perforation","title":"Clinical features"},{"location":"IM/Paediatric%20Medicine/GIT/Appendicitis%20%28Paediatrics%29.html#clinical-approach","text":"Take good family history and medications history Inspection Position of child in bed, lying still with hips and knees flexed?

It can occur at any age but is most likely in the infant between 3 and 18 months who suddenly develops screaming attacks of pain with vomiting. During each episode of pain the infant becomes pale and may draw up the legs. The spasms of pain tend to last for 2\u20133 minutes and occur at intervals of about 10\u201320 minutes, although after a while the pain becomes more persistent. Vomiting is an early symptom. The passage of a few loose stools early on represents evacuation of the bowel distal to the obstruction. The small volume and limited duration of loose stools in intussusception helps differentiate it from acute gastroenteritis. Congestion of the intussusceptum may lead to the passage of blood-stained or \u2018redcurrant jelly\u2019 stools. Many infants with intussusception present with little more than pallor, lethargy and vomiting, and may have little evidence of abdominal pain. Should these symptoms be ignored, the infant may progress to develop signs of septicaemia or shock. The infant with intussusception looks pale, lethargic, anxious and unwell. A vague mass may be felt in the right or left upper quadrants of the abdomen but, once abdominal distension has developed, the mass becomes obscure and difficult to palpate ( Fig. 20.1.1 ). The apex of the intussusceptum may be palpable on rectal examination in a few, and the examining glove may be blood-stained. A plain X-ray of the abdomen will often be normal but may show an unusual bowel gas distribution or features of bowel obstruction. Ultrasound examination may be helpful in making the diagnosis. Where intussusception is suspected clinically or confirmed on ultrasonography, a gas or barium enema must be performed (unless the child has peritonitis). The enema will demonstrate the position of the apex of the intussusception ( Fig. 20.1.2 ).

If gas enema facilities are not available, a barium enema under continuous fluoroscopic control is a less effective but satisfactory alternative. Peritonitis and septicaemia, which suggest the presence of dead bowel, are the only contraindications to attempted enema reduction. A dehydrated child should have intravenous fluid resuscitation and be wrapped in warm blankets before commencing an enema reduction. The success of enema reduction is recognized when there is sudden or rapid flow of gas or barium into the ileum. If partial reduction is achieved, and the child remains in good clinical condition, a further enema should be attempted after several hours (so called \u2018delayed repeat enema\u2019), and in about half of these patients it will be successful. Recurrence of intussusception occurs in about 9% of children after enema reduction, usually within days. Surgery is reserved for: those in whom enema reduction has failed those who have clinical evidence of necrotic bowel, such as peritonitis and septicaemia those in whom there is evidence of pathological lesions at the lead point.

On the second day the vomiting stopped but the diarrhoea persisted at a rate of more than eight stools per day. On presentation to the emergency department, Tim's weight was 13.6 kg, compared with 14.5 kg 3 weeks previously. He was clinically assessed to be 5\u20138% dehydrated and was treated with an oral rehydration solution via a nasogastric tube. A provisional diagnosis of acute gastroenteritis was made. His temperature gradually settled over 24 hours and oral feeds were introduced once rehydration was complete. His stools returned to their normal pattern after 5 days. Rapid stool testing for rotavirus antigen was positive.","title":"Intussusception"},{"location":"IM/Paediatric%20Medicine/GIT/Intussusception.html#intussusception","text":"In intussusception, the distal ileum (the intussusceptum) telescopes into adjoining distal bowel (the intussuscipiens), resulting in intestinal obstruction.

The vast majority of pediatric patients with SBS have undergone neonatal surgical resection of intestine. The most common etiologies in children are necrotizing enterocolitis (45%); intestinal atresias (23%); gastroschisis Hay_Ch21_p0626-0668.indd 638 20/03/18 12:07 PM GASTROINTESTINAL TRACT 639 (15%); volvulus (15%); and, less commonly, congenital short bowel, long-segment Hirschsprung disease, and ischemic bowel. In many instances, infants with SBS require PN in order to provide adequate caloric, fluid, and electrolyte delivery in the setting of insufficient intestinal absorptive function. The requirement of supplemental PN for more than 2\u20133 months in the setting of SBS or any other underlying disorder qualifies the diagnosis of intestinal failure (IF). The goal in management of the patient with SBS is to promote growth and adaptation of the intestine such that adequate nutrition can be delivered and absorbed enterally. Many factors, including patient\u2019s gestational age, postsurgical anatomy (including residual small bowel length and presence of ileocecal valve and/or colon), presence of small bowel bacterial overgrowth, and underlying surgical disease, influence the process and likelihood of bowel adaptation and achievement of enteral autonomy. No specific anatomic bowel length measurements offer 100% certainty in predicting clinical outcomes in SBS. \u00bb Symptoms & Signs Typical symptoms for the patient with SBS are related to their underlying malabsorptive state, including diarrhea, dehydration, electrolyte or micronutrient deficiency states, and growth failure. Patients with SBS are also at risk for small bowel obstruction, bowel dilation and dysmotility (with secondary small bowel bacterial overgrowth), hepatobiliary disorders including cholelithiasis, nephrolithiasis due to calcium oxalate stones, oral feeding challenges, and GI mucosal inflammatory problems including noninfectious colitis and anastomotic ulcerations. For patients with IF, complications related to underlying PN therapy are common and can be life threatening. PN-associated liver disease (PNALD) is a progressive cholestatic liver injury that occurs in pediatric patients on PN and may progress to end-stage liver disease in 10% of affected patients. Recurrent catheterrelated bloodstream infections are relatively common in pediatric patients with SBS and IF. Other complicationrelated central venous catheters including occlusions may require intervention. \u00bb Treatment & Prognosis Goal in management of SBS is to promote growth and adaptation while minimizing and/or treating complications of the underlying intestinal disorder or PN therapy. Intestinal rehabilitation for the child with SBS and IF refers to the multidisciplinary team approach to individual patient care, involving gastroenterology, nutrition, and surgery, and has been shown to improve outcomes. Enteral nutrition should be catered to favor absorption, commonly requiring continuous delivery of an elemental formula through a gastrostomy tube. Commonly prescribed pharmacologic adjuncts include acid suppressive therapy, antimotility and antidiarrheal agents, and antibiotics for the treatment of small bowel bacterial overgrowth. Emerging therapies targeted to promote bowel adaptation include glucagon-like peptide 2 analogues, which show promise in potentially increasing absorption and bowel adaptation in ongoing trials. Management for the patient with SBS and IF should include strategies to manage or prevent complications related to PN therapy, including infection and liver disease. Antimicrobial lock solutions distilled into central venous catheters using either ethanol or antibiotics may have a role in reducing infection rates. Compelling evidence over the past several years suggests that modification of parenteral lipid solution, either through reduction in dose of soy-based intralipid or replacement with a third-generation lipid solution (Omegaven or SMOF lipid), improves outcomes associated with PNALD in pediatric patients. Autologous bowel reconstructive surgery (bowel lengthening) should be considered in a patient who is failing to advance enterally and has anatomy amendable to surgical intervention, typically with regards to adequate bowel dilation. Both the serial transverse enteroplasty (STEP) procedure and longitudinal intestinal lengthening and tailoring (Bianchi) procedure have been successful in allowing weaning from TPN in up to 50% of patients in reported series. In recent years, the STEP procedure has gained favor as being potentially less technically demanding and repeatable, if the bowel dilates sufficiently after the initial procedure. When medical, nutritional, and surgical managements fail, intestinal transplantation may be considered for a child with refractory and life-threatening complications of IF.

Symptoms **** Nasal: rhinorrhoea (clear or yellow), nasal congestion and obstruction, itching, sneezing, nasal voice, snoring. **** Ocular: itching, lacrimation, redness, lid oedema. **** Lower respiratory tract: cough, wheeze, SOB. Diagnosis: taking an aeroallergen history History should focus on elucidating symptoms and their impact on life, atopic family history, and the presence of other atopic disorders. An aeroallergen history should focus on: **** Seasonal variation: perennial symptoms suggest house dust mite allergy; symptom onset in early spring suggests tree pollen allergy, and late spring/summer symptoms suggest grass pollen allergy. **** Presence of a furry pet (within the household, but also regular exposure elsewhere). **** Exposure to moulds (household/rural environments). **** Change in symptoms on exposure to new environments (e.g. on holiday). Examination **** Presence of \u2018allergic salute\u2019 (i.e. with horizontal nasal crease), allergic shiners. **** Chronic mouth-breathing. **** Presence of nasal polyps. Investigations These are usually limited in nature, but SPT/sIgE testing may be appropriate to help determine the responsible allergen.

Food allergy Food allergy in childhood is common, affecting 6\u20138% of children aged <3y. The commonest food allergies in early childhood are milk and egg. One to 3% of young children have cow\u2019s milk allergy. In later childhood, allergies to peanuts and tree nuts predominate. Other common allergens are fish, shellfish, wheat, and soy. Food allergy versus food intolerance Food intolerance is a non-immunologically mediated adverse reaction to food. It includes: **** Enzyme deficiencies, e.g. lactase deficiency. **** Pharmacological, e.g. tachycardias in heavy tea/coffee drinkers due to caffeine. **** Sensitivity to vasoactive amines in food, causing localized reactions such as lip swelling, e.g. cured meats, cheeses, fish, ripe bananas, oranges, tomatoes, strawberries. **** Toxin-mediated, e.g. scrombroid poisoning (histamine from spoilt fish), food poisoning. **** Chemical effects (gustatory rhinitis with hot/spicy foods). **** Irritant reactions. **** Infectious syndromes, e.g. food poisoning or acute urticaria with viral illness. Taking a food allergy history Careful history taking is important in a diagnosis of allergic disease, because it helps to differentiate allergic from non-allergic reactions, to identify potential triggers, and to direct investigations. **** Presenting symptoms: focus on gut, skin, and respiratory systems to differentiate IgE from non-IgE-mediated reactions (see Table 13.1 ). **** Timing of the reaction from ingestion. **** Previous exposure to the allergen and severity of reactions. **** Detailed feeding history, including breastfed/bottle-fed; weaning; foods avoided and why. **** Exposure to other common allergens (see Table 13.2 ): if they are being consuming regularly, there is no need to test for those allergens. **** Whether the reaction was preceded by exercise, viral illness, or alcohol consumption (as these can lower the threshold for reaction). **** History of other atopic diseases, including infantile eczema, asthma, and allergic rhinitis. **** Family history of atopy.
