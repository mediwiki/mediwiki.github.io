The creatinine may be normal despite a markedly reduced glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in the early stages of acute kidney injury (AKI) due to the time it takes for creatinine to accumulate in the body. This condition is also called acute renal failure (ARF). One consensus definition of AKI is called the RIFLE criteria. RISK: 1.5-fold increase in the serum creatinine or GFR decrease by 25% or urine output <0.5 mL/kg/hr for 6 hours. INJURY: Twofold increase in the serum creatinine or GFR decrease by 50% or urine output <0.5 mL/kg/hr for 12 hours. FAILURE: Threefold increase in the serum creatinine or GFR decrease by 75% or urine output of <0.5 mL/kg/hr for 24 hours, or anuria for 12 hours. LOSS: Complete loss of kidney function (i.e., requiring dialysis) for more than 4 weeks. ESRD: Complete loss of kidney function (i.e., requiring dialysis) for more than 3 months. Approach AKI may be nonoliguric, oliguric, or anuric. Severe AKI may occur without a reduction in urine output (nonoliguric AKI). General goals of therapy are reversing the initial insult to the kidney and/or supportive care as GFR recovers, as well as preventing fulminant kidney failure requiring temporary or permanent hemodialysis. Weight gain and edema are most common findings in patients with AKI. This is due to a positive water and sodium (Na+) balance. Characterized by azotemia (elevated BUN and Cr) Elevated BUN is also seen with catabolic drugs (e.g., steroids), GI/soft tissue bleeding (due to RBC digestion and re-absorption of urea), and dietary protein intake. Elevated Cr is also seen with increased muscle breakdown and various drugs. The baseline Cr level varies proportionately with muscle mass. Prognosis More than 80% of patients in whom AKI develops recover completely. However, prognosis varies widely depending on the severity of renal failure and other comorbidities. The older the patient and the more severe the insult, the lower is the likelihood of complete recovery. The most common cause of death is infection (75% of all deaths), followed by cardiorespiratory complications. Other nonfatal complications include chronic kidney injury and need for dialysis Life-threatening consequences volume overload hypoerkalaemia metabolic acidosis Risk factors: Diabetes, HTN, Elderly Approach Prerenal failure a. Most common cause of AKI; potentially reversible b. Etiology (decrease in systemic arterial blood volume or renal perfusion leading to renal ischemia)\u2014can complicate any disease that causes hypovolemia, low cardiac output, or systemic vasodilation Hypovolemia\u2014dehydration, excessive diuretic use, poor fluid intake, vomiting, diarrhea, burns, hemorrhage, CHF, cardiorenal syndrome Hypotension (systolic BP below 90 mm Hg), from sepsis, excessive, antihypertensive medications, bleeding, dehydration Renal arterial obstruction (kidney is hypoperfused despite elevated blood pressure) Cirrhosis, hepatorenal syndrome In patients with decreased renal perfusion, NSAIDs (constrict afferent arteriole), ACE inhibitors (cause efferent arteriole vasodilation), and cyclosporin can precipitate prerenal failure. Pathophysiology Renal blood flow decreases enough to lower the GFR, which leads to decreased clearance of metabolites (BUN, Cr, uremic toxins). Because the renal parenchyma is undamaged, tubular function (and therefore the concentrating ability) is preserved. Therefore, the kidney responds appropriately, conserving as much sodium and water as possible. This form of AKI is reversible on restoration of blood flow; but if hypoperfusion persists, ischemia results and can lead to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) Clinical features signs of volume depletion (dry mucous membranes, hypotension, tachycardia, decreased tissue turgor, oliguria/anuria) Diagnosis and Investigations Oliguria\u2014always found in prerenal failure (this is to preserve volume) Increased BUN-to-serum Cr ratio (>20:1 is the classic ratio)\u2014because kidney can reabsorb urea to increase sodium and water retention Increased urine osmolality (>500 mOsm/kg H2O)\u2014because the kidney is able to appropriately reabsorb water Decreased urine Na+ (<20 mEq/L with fractional excretion of sodium [FENa] <1%) because Na+ is avidly reabsorbed Increased urine\u2013plasma Cr ratio (>40:1)\u2014because much of the filtrate is reabsorbed (but not the creatinine) Bland urine sediment, indicating lack of significant cellular damage to glomeruli or tubules Intrinsic renal failure a. Kidney tissue (interstitium, glomeruli, tubules) is damaged such that glomerular filtration and tubular function are significantly impaired. Thus, kidneys are unable to concentrate urine effectively. b. Causes Tubular disease (ATN)\u2014can be caused by ischemia (most common cause), nephrotoxins (see Clinical Pearls 7-3 and 7-4) Glomerular disease (acute glomerulonephritis [GN])\u2014for example, Goodpasture syndrome, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, poststreptococcal GN, lupus Vascular disease\u2014for example, renal artery occlusion, TTP, HUS Interstitial disease\u2014for example, allergic interstitial nephritis, often due to a hypersensitivity reaction to medication c. Clinical features depend on the cause. Edema is usually present. Recovery may be possible but takes longer than in prerenal failure. d. Laboratory findings Decreased BUN-to-serum Cr ratio (<20:1, typically closer to 10:1 ratio) in comparison with prerenal failure. Both BUN and Cr levels are still elevated, but less urea is reabsorbed than in prerenal failure as kidney is no longer actively reabsorbing it. Increased urine Na+ (>40 mEq/L with FENa > 2% to 3%)\u2014because Na+ is poorly reabsorbed Decreased urine osmolality (<350 mOsm/kg H2O)\u2014because renal water reabsorption is impaired Decreased urine\u2013plasma Cr ratio (<20:1)\u2014because filtrate cannot be reabsorbed Postrenal failure a. Least common cause of AKI b. Obstruction of any segment of the urinary tract (with intact kidney) causes increased tubular pressure (urine produced cannot be excreted), which leads to decreased GFR. Blood supply and renal parenchyma are intact. Note that both kidneys must be obstructed (e.g., prostatic enlargement) for creatinine to rise. c. Renal function is restored if obstruction is relieved before the kidneys are damaged. d. Postrenal obstruction, if untreated, can lead to ATN. e. Causes Urethral obstruction secondary to enlarged prostate (BPH) is the most common cause Obstruction of solitary kidney Nephrolithiasis Obstructing neoplasm (bladder, cervix, prostate, and so on) Retroperitoneal fibrosis Ureteral obstruction is an uncommon cause because obstruction must be bilateral to cause renal failure. Diagnosis Blood tests EUC, FBC, LFT, Coags, ESR, CRP, CK Unclear cause - consider GMs Serum IG, electrophoresis, C3/C4, ASOT, Autoantibodies (ANA, ANCA, anti-dsDNA, anti-GBM) a. Elevation in BUN and Cr levels. Be aware that small changes in Cr may reflect a much more significant decrease in GFR. b. Electrolytes (retention of K+, PO4 3\u2212, drop in HCO3 \u2212 indicating acidosis, decrease in Na+ due to fluid retention) c. Albumin levels to monitor for nephrotic syndrome d. CBC with differential Urinalysis (Figure 7-2 and Table 7-2). a. A dipstick test positive for protein (3+, 4+) suggests intrinsic renal failure due to glomerular insult. b. Microscopic examination of the urine sediment: Crystals indicate presence of stones. Micro-organisms are seen in both infection and nonpathogenic colonization (differentiation made based on symptoms). Granular casts degeneration of cells and protein aggregates seen in ATN (\u201cmuddy brown\u201d casts) Hyaline casts are devoid of contents (seen in prerenal failure). RBC casts indicate glomerular disease. WBC casts indicate renal parenchymal inflammation. Fatty casts indicate nephrotic syndrome. Urine chemistry\u2014to distinguish between different forms of AKI. a. Urine Na+, Cr, and osmolality: Urine Na+ depends on dietary intake. b. FENa: collect urine and plasma electrolytes simultaneously = [(UNa )/(PNa )/(UCr)/PCr) \u00d7 100], where U = urine and P = plasma. Values below 1% suggest prerenal failure. Values above 2% to 3% suggest ATN. FENa is most useful if oliguria is present. If patient is on diuretics, UNa will be artificially elevated and fractional excretion of urea (FEUrea) must be used instead. c. Renal failure index 5 (uNa/[uCr/pCr]) \u00d7 100) Values below 1% suggest prerenal failure. Values above 1% suggest ATN. Urine culture and sensitivities\u2014if infection is suspected. Renal ultrasound. a. Primarily useful for evaluating kidney size and for excluding urinary tract obstruction (i.e., postrenal failure)\u2014presence of bilateral hydronephrosis or hydroureter b. Order for most patients with AKI\u2014unless the cause of the AKI is obvious and is not postrenal CT scan (abdomen and pelvis)\u2014may be helpful in some cases; usually done if renal ultrasound shows an abnormality such as hydronephrosis Renal biopsy\u2014useful occasionally if there is suspicion of acute GN or acute allergic interstitial nephritis Renal arteriography\u2014to evaluate for possible renal artery occlusion; should be performed only if specific therapy will make a difference CXR - pulmonary oedema ECG - hyperkalaemic changes Complications ECF volume expansion and resulting pulmonary edema\u2014treat with a diuretic (furosemide) Metabolic a. Hyperkalemia\u2014due to decreased excretion of K+ and the movement of potassium from ICF to ECF due to tissue destruction and acidosis b. Metabolic acidosis (with increased anion gap)\u2014due to decreased excretion of hydrogen ions; if severe (below 16 mEq/L), correct with sodium bicarbonate c. Hypocalcemia\u2014loss of ability to form active vitamin D and rapid development of PTH resistance d. Hyponatremia may occur if water intake is greater than body losses, or if a volume-depleted patient consumes excessive hypotonic solutions. (Hypernatremia may also be seen in hypovolemic states.) e. Hyperphosphatemia\u2014due to decreased clearance f. Hyperuricemia Uremia\u2014toxic end products of metabolism accumulate (especially from protein metabolism), leading to such complications as: a. Platelet dysfunction b. Immune dysfunction c. Pericarditis d. Encephalopathy Infection a. A common and serious complication of AKI (occurs in 50% to 60% of cases). The cause is probably multifactorial, but uremia itself is thought to impair immune function. b. Examples include pneumonia, UTI, wound infection, and sepsis. Treatment General measures (see also Table 7-3). a. Avoid medications that decrease renal blood flow (NSAIDs) and/or that are nephrotoxic (e.g., aminoglycosides, radiocontrast agents). b. Adjust medication dosages for level of renal function. c. Correct fluid imbalance. If volume depleted, give IV fluids. However, many patients with AKI are volume overloaded (especially if they are oliguric or anuric), so diuresis may be necessary IF SYMPTOMATIC The goal is to strike a balance between correcting volume deficits and avoiding volume overload (while maintaining adequate urine output). Remember that urine output is a reflection of renal blood flow (volume status) and GFR (kidney function). Monitor fluid balance by daily weight measurements (most accurate estimate) and intake\u2013output records. Be sure to take into account the patient\u2019s cardiac history when considering treatment options for fluid imbalances (i.e., do not give excessive fluid to a patient with CHF). d. Correct electrolyte disturbances if present. e. Optimize cardiac output. BP should be approximately 120 to 140/80 to 90. f. Order dialysis if symptomatic uremia, intractable acidemia, hyperkalemia, or volume overload develop. Indications for urgent dialysis often remembered by \u201cAEIOU\u201d mnemonic: Acidosis, Electrolytes, Intoxications (such as in overdoses), volume Overload, Uremia. Prerenal a. Treat the underlying disorder (such as hypovolemic or cardiogenic shock). b. Give fluids to maintain euvolemia and restore blood pressure\u2014do not give to patients with edema or ascites. May be necessary to stop antihypertensive medications. Remember that NS is often preferred unless acidemia is present (may worsen with hyperchloremia), in which case LR can be used. c. Eliminate any offending agents (ACE inhibitors, NSAIDs). d. If patient is unstable, Swan\u2013Ganz monitoring for accurate assessment of intravascular volume. Intrinsic a. Once ATN develops, therapy is supportive and renal function generally recovers. Eliminate the cause/offending agent. b. If oliguric, a trial of furosemide may help to increase urine flow. This improves fluid balance. Postrenal\u2014a bladder catheter may be inserted to decompress the urinary tract. Consider urology consultation. a. Be aware of the potential for post-obstructive diuresis and a rapid increase in urine output when obstruction is resolved, which may require IV fluid replacement.","title":"Acute kidney injury (AKI)"},{"location":"IM/Nephrology/Acute%20Kidney%20Injury.html#acute-kidney-injury-aki","text":"","title":"Acute kidney injury (AKI)"},{"location":"IM/Nephrology/Acute%20Kidney%20Injury.html#background","text":"","title":"Background"},{"location":"IM/Nephrology/Acute%20Kidney%20Injury.html#definition","text":"A rapid decline in renal function over hours or days, with an increase in serum creatinine level while the cutoff for rise in creatinine which qualifies as an \u201cinjury\u201d is controversial, an increase of as little as 0.3 mg/dL may have clinical relevance, while traditional definitions describe a relative increase of 50% or an absolute increase of 0.5 to 1.0 mg/dL).

Kidney tissue (interstitium, glomeruli, tubules) is damaged such that glomerular filtration and tubular function are significantly impaired. Thus, kidneys are unable to concentrate urine effectively. b. Causes Tubular disease (ATN)\u2014can be caused by ischemia (most common cause), nephrotoxins (see Clinical Pearls 7-3 and 7-4) Glomerular disease (acute glomerulonephritis [GN])\u2014for example, Goodpasture syndrome, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, poststreptococcal GN, lupus Vascular disease\u2014for example, renal artery occlusion, TTP, HUS Interstitial disease\u2014for example, allergic interstitial nephritis, often due to a hypersensitivity reaction to medication c. Clinical features depend on the cause. Edema is usually present. Recovery may be possible but takes longer than in prerenal failure. d. Laboratory findings Decreased BUN-to-serum Cr ratio (<20:1, typically closer to 10:1 ratio) in comparison with prerenal failure. Both BUN and Cr levels are still elevated, but less urea is reabsorbed than in prerenal failure as kidney is no longer actively reabsorbing it. Increased urine Na+ (>40 mEq/L with FENa > 2% to 3%)\u2014because Na+ is poorly reabsorbed Decreased urine osmolality (<350 mOsm/kg H2O)\u2014because renal water reabsorption is impaired Decreased urine\u2013plasma Cr ratio (<20:1)\u2014because filtrate cannot be reabsorbed Postrenal failure a. Least common cause of AKI b. Obstruction of any segment of the urinary tract (with intact kidney) causes increased tubular pressure (urine produced cannot be excreted), which leads to decreased GFR.

Avoid medications that decrease renal blood flow (NSAIDs) and/or that are nephrotoxic (e.g., aminoglycosides, radiocontrast agents). b. Adjust medication dosages for level of renal function. c. Correct fluid imbalance. If volume depleted, give IV fluids. However, many patients with AKI are volume overloaded (especially if they are oliguric or anuric), so diuresis may be necessary IF SYMPTOMATIC The goal is to strike a balance between correcting volume deficits and avoiding volume overload (while maintaining adequate urine output). Remember that urine output is a reflection of renal blood flow (volume status) and GFR (kidney function). Monitor fluid balance by daily weight measurements (most accurate estimate) and intake\u2013output records. Be sure to take into account the patient\u2019s cardiac history when considering treatment options for fluid imbalances (i.e., do not give excessive fluid to a patient with CHF). d. Correct electrolyte disturbances if present. e. Optimize cardiac output. BP should be approximately 120 to 140/80 to 90. f. Order dialysis if symptomatic uremia, intractable acidemia, hyperkalemia, or volume overload develop.

Treatment"},{"location":"IM/Nephrology/Dialysis%20in%20Renal%20Failure.html","text":"Dialysis Background There are three main forms of dialysis: Haemodialysis (HD) Haemofiltration Peritoneal dialysis (PD) How to choose dialysis Independent patients \u2192 allow maintained independence \u2192 peritoneal dialysis If potential issues with peritoneum or bowel, or high risk infection \u2192 haemodialysis If not independent \u2192 haemodialysis Indications for dialysis Acidosis Electrolyte abnormalities Intoxication Overload (fluid) Uremia A. General Characteristics 1. Overview a. Dialysis is the artificial mechanism by which fluid and toxic solutes are removed from the circulation when the kidneys cannot do so sufficiently. b. In all forms of dialysis, the blood interfaces with an artificial solution resembling human plasma (called the dialysate), and diffusion of fluid and solutes occurs across a semipermeable membrane. c. The two major methods of dialyzing a patient are hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis (discussed below). d. The majority of dialysis patients in the United States receive hemodialysis at hospitals or dialysis centers, but more and more patients are opting for chronic ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). e. For patients with life-threatening complications of AKI, continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) can be used for constant renal support. This also avoids the larger fluid shifts of intermittent hemodialysis which hemodynamically unstable or heart failure patients may not be able to handle. B. When to Initiate Dialysis 1. General settings in which dialysis is considered. a. CKD\u2014dialysis serves as a bridge to renal transplantation or as a permanent treatment when the patient is not a transplantation candidate. b. AKI\u2014dialysis is often required as a temporary measure until the patient\u2019s renal function improves, often due to absolute indications (see Quick Hit). c. Overdose of medications or ingestions of substances cleared by the kidneys\u2014 some, but not all medications and toxins can be dialyzed (see Quick Hit). 2. Nonemergent indications a. Note: Cr and BUN levels are not absolute indications for dialysis, however some nephrologists will decide to initiate dialysis once a CKD patient\u2019s GFR drops below a certain value. b. Symptoms of uremia Nausea and vomiting Lethargy/deterioration in mental status, encephalopathy, seizures Pericarditis Emergent indications (usually in the setting of renal failure) a. Life-threatening manifestations of volume overload Pulmonary edema Hypertensive emergency refractory to antihypertensive agents b. Severe, refractory electrolyte disturbances, for example, hyperkalemia, hypermagnesemia c. Severe metabolic acidosis d. Drug toxicity/ingestions (particularly in patients with renal failure): methanol, ethylene glycol, lithium, aspirin C. Hemodialysis 1. Process a. The patient\u2019s blood is pumped by an artificial pump outside of the body through the dialyzer, which typically consists of fine capillary networks of semipermeable membranes. The dialysate flows on the outside of these networks, and fluid and solutes diffuse across the membrane. b. The patient\u2019s blood must be heparinized to prevent clotting in the dialyzer. 2. Frequency: Most hemodialysis patients require 3 to 5 hours of dialysis 3 days per week. 3. Access a. Use the central catheter placed using the Seldinger technique most often in the subclavian or jugular vein for temporary access. b. Tunneled catheters are placed under the skin which leads to a lower rate of infection. These catheters are often suitable for use up to 6 months. c. Arteriovenous fistula. Best form of permanent dialysis access. It requires vascular surgery to connect the radial or brachial artery to veins in the forearm. An audible bruit and palpable thrill (due to high flow) over the fistula indicates that it is patent. Absence of these findings is abnormal and is concerning for thrombosis of the vessel. d. An alternative to an arteriovenous fistula is an implantable graft\u2014typically made of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE). 4. Alternatives to traditional hemodialysis. a. Continuous arteriovenous hemodialysis (CAVHD) and continuous venovenous hemodialysis (CVVHD) are often used in hemodynamically unstable patients, such as ICU patients with AKI. This allows for closer control of electrolytes and fluid status. b. Lower flow rates of blood and dialysate enable dialysis to occur while minimizing rapid shifts in volume and osmolality which these patients may not be able to tolerate. c. They require highly efficient dialyzers to be effective. 5. Advantages of hemodialysis. a. It is more efficient than peritoneal dialysis. High flow rates and efficient dialyzers shorten the period of time required for dialysis. b. It can be initiated more quickly than peritoneal dialysis, using temporary vascular access in the emergent setting. 6. Disadvantages of hemodialysis. a. It is less similar to the physiology of natural kidney function than is peritoneal dialysis, predisposing the patient to the following: Hypotension due to rapid removal of intravascular volume leading to rapid fluid shifts from the extravascular space into cells. Hypo-osmolality due to solute removal. b. Requires vascular access. D. Peritoneal Dialysis 1. Process a. The peritoneum serves as the dialysis membrane. Dialysate fluid is infused into the peritoneal cavity, then fluids and solutes from the peritoneal capillaries diffuse into the dialysate fluid, which is drained from the abdomen. b. A hyperosmolar (high-glucose) solution is used, and water is removed from the blood via osmosis. 2. Frequency: dialysate fluid is drained and replaced every hour in acute peritoneal dialysis, but only once every 4 to 8 hours in CAPD. 3. Access a. With CAPD, dialysate is infused into the peritoneal fluid via an implanted catheter. b. A temporary catheter is used for acute peritoneal dialysis. 4. Advantages a. The patient can learn to perform dialysis on his or her own. b. It mimics the physiology of normal kidney function more closely than hemodialysis in that it is more continuous. 5. Disadvantages a. High glucose load may lead to hyperglycemia and hypertriglyceridemia. b. Peritonitis is a significant potential complication. c. The patients must be highly motivated to self-administer it. d.

General Characteristics 1. Overview a. Dialysis is the artificial mechanism by which fluid and toxic solutes are removed from the circulation when the kidneys cannot do so sufficiently. b. In all forms of dialysis, the blood interfaces with an artificial solution resembling human plasma (called the dialysate), and diffusion of fluid and solutes occurs across a semipermeable membrane. c. The two major methods of dialyzing a patient are hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis (discussed below). d. The majority of dialysis patients in the United States receive hemodialysis at hospitals or dialysis centers, but more and more patients are opting for chronic ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). e. For patients with life-threatening complications of AKI, continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) can be used for constant renal support. This also avoids the larger fluid shifts of intermittent hemodialysis which hemodynamically unstable or heart failure patients may not be able to handle. B. When to Initiate Dialysis 1. General settings in which dialysis is considered. a. CKD\u2014dialysis serves as a bridge to renal transplantation or as a permanent treatment when the patient is not a transplantation candidate. b. AKI\u2014dialysis is often required as a temporary measure until the patient\u2019s renal function improves, often due to absolute indications (see Quick Hit). c. Overdose of medications or ingestions of substances cleared by the kidneys\u2014 some, but not all medications and toxins can be dialyzed (see Quick Hit). 2. Nonemergent indications a. Note: Cr and BUN levels are not absolute indications for dialysis, however some nephrologists will decide to initiate dialysis once a CKD patient\u2019s GFR drops below a certain value. b. Symptoms of uremia Nausea and vomiting Lethargy/deterioration in mental status, encephalopathy, seizures Pericarditis Emergent indications (usually in the setting of renal failure) a. Life-threatening manifestations of volume overload Pulmonary edema Hypertensive emergency refractory to antihypertensive agents b. Severe, refractory electrolyte disturbances, for example, hyperkalemia, hypermagnesemia c. Severe metabolic acidosis d. Drug toxicity/ingestions (particularly in patients with renal failure): methanol, ethylene glycol, lithium, aspirin C. Hemodialysis 1. Process a. The patient\u2019s blood is pumped by an artificial pump outside of the body through the dialyzer, which typically consists of fine capillary networks of semipermeable membranes. The dialysate flows on the outside of these networks, and fluid and solutes diffuse across the membrane. b. The patient\u2019s blood must be heparinized to prevent clotting in the dialyzer. 2. Frequency: Most hemodialysis patients require 3 to 5 hours of dialysis 3 days per week. 3. Access a. Use the central catheter placed using the Seldinger technique most often in the subclavian or jugular vein for temporary access. b. Tunneled catheters are placed under the skin which leads to a lower rate of infection. These catheters are often suitable for use up to 6 months. c. Arteriovenous fistula. Best form of permanent dialysis access. It requires vascular surgery to connect the radial or brachial artery to veins in the forearm. An audible bruit and palpable thrill (due to high flow) over the fistula indicates that it is patent. Absence of these findings is abnormal and is concerning for thrombosis of the vessel. d. An alternative to an arteriovenous fistula is an implantable graft\u2014typically made of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE). 4. Alternatives to traditional hemodialysis. a. Continuous arteriovenous hemodialysis (CAVHD) and continuous venovenous hemodialysis (CVVHD) are often used in hemodynamically unstable patients, such as ICU patients with AKI. This allows for closer control of electrolytes and fluid status. b. Lower flow rates of blood and dialysate enable dialysis to occur while minimizing rapid shifts in volume and osmolality which these patients may not be able to tolerate. c. They require highly efficient dialyzers to be effective. 5. Advantages of hemodialysis. a. It is more efficient than peritoneal dialysis. High flow rates and efficient dialyzers shorten the period of time required for dialysis. b. It can be initiated more quickly than peritoneal dialysis, using temporary vascular access in the emergent setting. 6. Disadvantages of hemodialysis. a. It is less similar to the physiology of natural kidney function than is peritoneal dialysis, predisposing the patient to the following: Hypotension due to rapid removal of intravascular volume leading to rapid fluid shifts from the extravascular space into cells.

There are two types of peritoneal dialysis: Continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) - as described above, with each lasting 30-40 minutes and each lasting 4-8 hours. The patient may go about their normal activities with the dialysis solution inside their abdomenexchange dwell time Automated peritoneal dialysis (APD) - a dialysis machine fills and drains the abdomen while the patient is sleeping, performing 3-5 over 8-10 hours each nightexchanges","title":"Complications"},{"location":"IM/Nephrology/Peritoneal%20dialysis%20%28PD%29.html#questions","text":"","title":"Questions"},{"location":"IM/Nephrology/Sterile%20pyuria.html","text":"Sterile Pyuria Background Sterile pyuria is defined as (??)
