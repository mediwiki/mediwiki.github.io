potential of glucose which is then extracted in the citric acid cycle and oxidate phosphorylation pyruvate can also be used in [[fermentation]] to produce lactic acid in the body pyruvate can also be used to synthesis alanine (Amino acid) or in [[fatty acid synthesis]] Phases of glycolysis Phase 1: Preparatory phase - Gluc Glucose is phosphorylated at the hydroxyl group on C6 by hexokinase to form Glucose 6-phosphate (g6p) This phosphorylation step utilises ATP as a phosphate donor this first phosphorylation event can only happen on C6 as C1 is a carbonyl group which cannot be phosphorylated g6p is converted to fructose 6-phosphate (f6p) by phosphohexose isomerase This step is necessary to free up the C1 carbonyl groupinto a hydroxyl group (for further phosphorylation) f6p is
