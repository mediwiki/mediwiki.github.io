<p>Q: Where do you see yourself in five years
I like to think about where I see myself in five years in terms of my clinical academic and personal goals personal goals. Clinically, I see myself completing my basic vision training and hopefully in a competitive advanced training program. I would like to see myself dual training in some form of sub specialized medicine. And. General Medicine In terms of general medicine training, I'd like to be at a regional or rural hospital. And hopefully train myself to a position where one day in the future I can practice medicine in a remote setting. One particular hospital comes to mind where I would like to practice one day in the future. It is at Moree Hospital. In terms of my academic pursuits, I see myself starting either an Enfield or a phd. Over the next five years. I'll be building up my academic affiliations and collaborations with other researchers as well as building a strong. research portfolio for my cv. So I. am competitive for a phd. Program and research scholarship and grants. Currently I have affiliations with the Westminster Plaid Research Institute in terms of digital health research. And I believe in the future of my ph D. Direction would be in the same area. Per. Personally, I find myself very excited about opportunities to teach and I have strong affiliations with the University of Sydney and with the University of Newcastle. I've been a casual academic at the University of Sydney for the last seven years in the disciplines of Medicine, health, public health and science. And I would like to read. that association in relationship much more than where I have been so far. I've also been working with the University of Newcastle as well as a shooter, and I really hope that I have time in the next five years to really remain on that teaching program.</p>
<p>Q: How would you describe your communication skills?
I think I have good communication skills. On a day to day basis, I practice communication with my peers, my juniors, by seeing your colleagues at light health staff, but also with patients and their family. over the last term, for example, in emergency of really practice a lot of my learnings from previous rotations like geriatrics, where when I see a patient, particularly one from a vulnerable background like an elderly patient from a nursing home, I make the conscious effort to communicate what I think and my concerns with family members as well as taking histories and calling up their property teams I've had examples in the past where because of my communication and discussions with other teams and even my own consultants, I've been able to get patients who have had unmanaged and lost the follow up from previous multiple myelomas taken over care by hematology team and really been worked up with good outcomes including linkage with parative care teams, whereas otherwise there would have been sent home with Endone back to a nursing home when no one could really advocate for them Speaking two patients is very important. Just last week at a lovely lady who came in with extreme bad acceptable neurologists secondary to a missed fracture and C1 C2 following a fall at home. She's been looking all over the shop all over Australia for help in terms of minimizing that pain. And really I had to sit down with her and with strong active listen and with my active listening skills and empathy I really tried to understand where she came from and did all I could to arrange services for her including linking her up with Ronald Shores neurosurgical service and. making sure that she had follow up with the outpatient chronic pain teams. My role with her largely resolved around revolved around. sending expectations and even though we couldn't really do much to help her even with the failed occipital block, she really thanked us for listening and trying to understand where she came from. She felt like we cared. That's all we could really do for her. I communicate well with my seniors. I make sure that in situations where information needs to be fed up the chain, I maintain an open line of communication and I'm very honest with them. If I don't know something, I make it very clear that I don't know. I take responsibility for what things I say. I found that this was very helpful, especially in my term at Wyong Hospital, where a lot of the time I didn't have a registrar because of my honesty and because of my detailed clinical assessment and communications with my senior, they were able to trust my word and gave me a lot more responsibility in terms of management of my patients. I found that what also speaking to my juniors was very important. Communications extremely important, particularly when you speak to Eugene is because they're the ones who are going to be doing a lot of the work regarding console. So they're the ones who are going to be communicating a lot of ideas with teams and families. Well, without clearly communicating what your thinking and what the ideas are, I think junior staff are left confused. Even at Wyong Hospital, I had to look after an intern and an aim while the resident there has been. much of the time. because they were new to medicine. They weren't very familiar with how to run clean and concise consults. And so in order to maximize everyone's comfort and efficiency, but also help them build confidence. I spent much of that time. whenever I asked them to do a concert, I would give them a very clear question, something that could be broken down even into a yes-no question That way, as well as communicating what relevant features and facts they were and at times even helping them write out a note for the consult so they knew what kinds of information they registered might want. Because of that, we had a very good working relationship between the cardiology team and the General Medicine team. And I found that my assistant of Medicine was very, very comfortable consulting other teams while we were there. Look on reflection, communication is something that I value extremely as a doctor. I have found that good communication maintains it is important for maintaining a respect to other teams as well as other parts about the other members of Allied health nursing staff and allied health staff get involved in NDTS with us and through that without advocate for our patients effectively their good communication. I've had pharmacy. I think my attitude towards communication working in team settings is very good. I am very approachable and friendly but I'm also very concise and ask appropriate questions with a good level of research and understanding. And because of that, the kings are the people I communicate with fewer respected. I've had nursing star. I've even had pharmacy stuff come up to me and thank me for being such an easy intern to work with in the past.</p>
<p>Q: Given an example of a situation where you showed empathy towards a patient
Just last week, I had a patient in emergency, a lovely 80 year old lady who came in with tear box sipped neuralgia. She had come in that day after the JP and Oscar to turn up to hospital because they had done an outpatient scan for an MRI. I passion MRI scanned for a brainstorm. Now the story is six months ago. She had a fall and secondary to four. We were wondering if she ever had a fracture of C1 C2 because she had some oxygen in your algebra as a result of that. This headache lasted for last exponents. She's been battling with it. She's also had Parkinson's disease, which causes her to ride and move around in a way that really triggers the acceptable neuralgia. She couldn't. find any solutions over the last six months, and she spent the last few months trying to get in contact with experimental approaches to headache. At 1 point she tried to look for an infrared helmet down in Adelaide by a neurologist She's been traveling across the world trying to find a solution. And unfortunately, she quit. The original CTI was done in ADR for the full didn't show a fracture and in fact, they probably didn't show a fracture because of movement artifact at that time. Now, the more she's had since had specked scans, bones scans another Mri's. And this final repeat MRI did show a fracture, showed a fracture of the anterior C1 and fatch of the odotonid process in a picture of the density. in C2 she had come in with the hub that she would get a treatments and finally have a solution to the headache. And unfortunately, my role in this situation was to deliver the bad news I had to speak to her and try to understand what she came from. I used to tone in a similar language in a similar I had to match her tone, match her amplitude I try to use empathetic language and really are sorry dear what? do you think is happening I invited myself in to give her a talk and try to explain to her the situation after we found that fracture I matched her and I did what I could to match her in in conversational approach and style and and how I presented myself and in effect what I was really trying to do in this situation was show empathy towards her. I made physical contact. I held her head and and at times she started crying while speaking to me and I grabbed the tissues and I told her something that I heard myself when I was at Wyong Hospital when we had to deliver bad news that a patient had cancer. I told her it's OK to cry. She was apologizing for crying and I said it's OK. It's fine. It's fine for you to cry. It's fine for you to be sad and it makes it's OK for you to be sad. There's no reason to apologize. This is a hard hard symptom to deal with. And you've been trying your best to deal with for the last 6 months, Unfortunately, at this point in time, we didn't have any options available to her She was hoping for anything. We offered the potential of doing occipital block. I spoke to the Royal North Shore neurosurgical services and I spoke to my own neurology team who had previously seen her. And at the end of the day, I showed as much empathy as I could. I showed empathy to my patients, even though I didn't have a solution. And even though we as a medical team didn't have a solution But I reassured that there will be follow up and we will keep finding all keep looking for a solution and that might include her seeing the pain specialists that she'd been referred to or following up the neuro surgical clinic that I had organized for her. at the end of the day, I showed empathy by being. honest with her and. not an understanding the I showed empathy by understanding the position she was in and she was very thankful that I was honest with her. and I was able to tell her what. she was thankful that was honest with her and I was able to tell her what she needed to hear. I'm sorry. This isn't a particularly happy example of showing everything towards a patient, I think. Unfortunately, not everything in medicine has a good solution. And even when we do show empathy, we might not have the right solution. The way I showed empathy was that I tried to lookout for her and I tried to speak up before her.</p>
<p>Just last week, at a patient emergency, a lovely year old lady who had coming six months earlier, having had a fall with headstroke, she's going to bar ground up Parkinson's disease and at the time we did a CT brain and sea spine in the context of motion artifacts. We couldn't see any fractures, but since that day she had a left side acceptable neuralgia that was. damaging her social function. She was unable to leave the house. She wasn't able to spend time with the friends and ultimately she had a lot of social issues as a result of this debilitating disorder. She was seeing urologists and across the last six months she had multiple Mris pet scans, spec scans, bone scans, CTS, the brain and spine, and she's even tried to see a neurologist who touted the use of infrared light for headaches. Unfortunately, that day she the day I saw her <strong><em>* come in. GP had referred her in after she had an MRI scan, which had actually finally demonstrated a fracture in C1 in the adult process of C2. I picked her up and I tried to workout what was going on and she was obviously in distress uncomfortable with the rapid the. the kinetic movements that she had in the background of Parkinson's. But that triggered off the position or pain that was causing her. oxyburne neurouja to be set off. and while talking to her, I took a history and I tried to understand what's going on. I corroborated this with the notes that we had in our system and realized that she was really just trying to find a solution to this pain. And this is something that she's been working on the last 6 months and finally she had a solution, a glimpse of hope. I'm sure you all know where this is heading, but the occipital neuralgia is remarkably hard to treat. There wasn't an option available. I'd spoken to neurosurgery with the available MRI and their plans were that she was probably not a good candidate for surgery but in effect, she also should have tried. We should also try to accept a nerve block. So I spoke to I brought her aside and I spoke to her and I did so in a quiet environment. I said to her, hey, dear this is what your image shows and it's possible that we actually missed the fracture from the initial scans. and I matched the tone and I matched her body. patterns and body movements. Body language. And I expressed this in. in a way that I asked if she would be happy with me asking. Well, when I asked her what does she think she would should or she think she would find out in the scan? What are you </em></strong>* the scan means for her to try to. understand what she understands about the result of this and what she would hope to achieve in this emission in the hospital. And unfortunately, as we all probably know where this goes, I had to break the bad news. I had to tell her that unfortunately the scan does potentially show a reason for why she's experiencing what she has experienced. But the options are still quite limited. Being in hospital, she wasn't going to have any new treatment started for her that she hadn't already had And this means that the only options are really available for us still going to be the our patient's pain specialist. And now potentially the raw notion neurosurgical clinic tissue is going to be reviewed at and she started a cry. She cried because she had tried so hard to find a solution and that solution still couldn't be offered to her. She had started a cried because she couldn't bear the thought of continuing to experience this kind of pain and not being able to see her friends and go out anymore. She had begun to cry because her husband hadn't been able to go out with her and have dinner with her for the last six months because of this pain. And there's a lot of social stresses in board In order for me to show empathy, I made contact with her. I heard her hands. Look, I'm sorry. Unfortunately, there isn't much we can do in this situation But there are now additional options and additional things we can go down additional roads. We can go down. But a lot of this might be And I told her to look. It's okay to cry. If anything, it's more than fair for her to cry. She's been in pain. She's experienced somet Of us will never experience in our lives, and unfortunately this result. in declining a function. This client in a social capacity, and I felt bad for her, but at the end of the day, she thanked me. Let me at the end day, she thanked me. She thanked people understanding her struggle and thanked me for understanding her pain. Thank me for doing what I could do to help her and advocate for her in as many words as I could. And at the end of the day, she went home. They're in pain, but with a bit of hope. </p></div>
