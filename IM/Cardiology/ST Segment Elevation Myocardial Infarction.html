<h1 id="st-segment-elevation-myocardial-infarction">ST Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction</h1>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<ul>
<li>MI is due to necrosis of myocardium as a result of an interruption of blood supply (after a thrombotic occlusion of a coronary artery previously narrowed by atherosclerosis).<ul>
<li>Most cases are due to acute coronary thrombosis: Atheromatous plaque ruptures into the vessel lumen, and thrombus forms on top of this lesion, which causes occlusion of the vessel.</li>
<li>MI is associated with a 30% mortality rate; half of the deaths are prehospital. Most deaths are due to a new onset arrhythmia</li>
<li>Most patients with MI have history of angina, risk factors for CAD, or history of arrhythmias.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="pathology">Pathology</h2>
<h2 id="clinical-features">Clinical features</h2>
<ul>
<li>Chest pain<ul>
<li>Intense substernal pressure sensation; often described as “crushing” and “an elephant standing on my chest.”</li>
<li>Radiation to neck, jaw, arms, or back, commonly to the left side.</li>
<li>Similar to angina pectoris in character and distribution but much more severe and lasts longer. Unlike in angina, pain may not respond to nitroglycerin.</li>
<li>Some patients may have epigastric discomfort.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Can be asymptomatic in up to one-third of patients; painless infarcts or atypical presentations more likely in postoperative patients, the elderly, diabetic patients, and women and indigenous australians.</li>
<li>Other symptoms<ul>
<li>Dyspnea</li>
<li>Diaphoresis</li>
<li>Weakness, fatigue</li>
<li>Nausea and vomiting</li>
<li>Sense of impending doom</li>
<li>Syncope</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Sudden cardiac death—usually due to ventricular fibrillation (VFib)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="diagnostic-criteria">Diagnostic criteria</h2>
<h2 id="investigations">Investigations</h2>
<ul>
<li>ECG<ul>
<li>Markers for ischemia/infarction include<ul>
<li>Peaked T waves: Occur very early and may be missed</li>
<li>ST-segment elevation indicates transmural injury and can be diagnostic of an acute infarct</li>
<li>Q waves: Evidence for necrosis (specific)—Q waves are usually seen late; typically not seen acutely</li>
<li>T-wave inversion is sensitive but not specific</li>
<li>ST-segment depression: Subendocardial injury</li>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>2mm in 2+ continguous anterior leads OR 1mm elevation in limb leads OR new LBBB</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Categories of infarcts<ul>
<li>ST-segment elevation infarct: Transmural (involves entire thickness of wall); tends to be larger Non–ST-segment elevation infarct: Subendocardial (involves inner one-third to one-half of the wall); tends to be smaller, and presentation is similar to UA —cardiac enzymes differentiate the two</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Cardiac enzymes—currently the diagnostic gold standard for myocardial injury</li>
<li>Troponins (Troponin I and T)—most important enzyme test to order<ul>
<li>Increases within 3 to 5 hours and returns to normal in 5 to 14 days; reaches a peak in 24 to 48 hours.</li>
<li>Greater sensitivity and specificity than CK-MB for myocardial injury.</li>
<li>Obtain serum levels of either troponin T or troponin I on admission, and again every 6 hours for 18 to 24 hours.</li>
<li>Troponin I can be falsely elevated in patients with renal failure; thus following trend of levels is important.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>CK-MB—less commonly used<ul>
<li>Increases within 4 to 8 hours and returns to normal in 48 to 72 hours; reaches a peak in 24 hours.</li>
<li>When measured within 24 to 36 hours of onset of chest pain, has greater than 95% sensitivity and specificity.</li>
<li>Levels of total CK and CK-MB should be measured on admission and every 8 hours thereafter for 24 hours.</li>
<li>Most helpful in detecting recurrent infarction given quicker return to baseline than troponin.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Remember the PAILS mnemonic when assessing for reciprocal changes:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>PAILS stands for P-posterior A-anterior I-inferior L-lateral S-septal.</li>
<li>ST elevations in these leads most commonly create reciprocal ST depressions in the corresponding leads of the next letter in the mnemonic.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="management">Management</h2>
<ul>
<li>Admit patient to a cardiac monitored floor (CCU) and establish IV access. Give
supplemental oxygen for hypoxia and analgesics</li>
<li>
<p>Medical therapy</p>
<ul>
<li>DAPT<ul>
<li>Aspirin<ul>
<li>Antiplatelet agent reduces coronary reocclusion by inhibiting platelet aggregation on top of the thrombus Has been shown to reduce mortality and should be part of long-term maintenance therapy</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>P2Y12 inhibitors (clopidogrel, ticagrelor)<ul>
<li>Used in conjunction with aspirin; have been shown to reduce recurrent MI Ticagrelor has  improved mortality compared to clopidogrel in the PLATO trial (its use is limited by cost, frequent dosing, and common side effect of dyspnea). Duration of therapy depends on decision to perform PCI versus CABG, risk factors of patient</li>
<li>Use 600mg if getting PCI, 300mg if getting tPA</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Heparin
Initiate in all patients with MI; prevents progression of thrombus; however, has not been shown to decrease mortality<ul>
<li>LMWH, specifically enoxaparin, is preferred over unfractionated heparin, as shown in the ExTRACT-TIMI 25 trial as well as a recent meta-analysis. Enoxaparin was shown to decrease the risk of recurrent MI versus unfractionated heparin.</li>
<li>Heparin is used in the case of severe kidney failure</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>GPIIb/IIIa inhibitor is also given if the patient is to recieve a PCA - epitifibatide, abciximab, tirofiban</li>
<li>β-Blockers - use atenolol or metoprolol (unless LVF, low LVEF, where bisoprolol, carvedilol, nebivolol, metoprolol succinate are preferred)<ul>
<li>Block stimulation of HR and contractility to reduce oxygen demand and decrease the incidence of arrhythmias Reduce remodeling of the myocardium post-MI Have been shown to reduce mortality and should be part of maintenance therapy</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>ACE inhibitors<ul>
<li>Initiate within hours of hospitalization if there are no contraindications Have been shown to reduce mortality and should be part of long-term maintenance therapy</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Statins<ul>
<li>Reduce risk of further coronary events Stabilize plaques and lower cholesterol The PROVE IT-TIMI 22 trial showed the superiority of starting atorvastatin 80 mg over other statins before discharging a STEMI patient Should be part of maintenance therapy</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Oxygen<ul>
<li>May limit ischemic myocardial injury in hypoxic patients. Does not improve mortality in patients with normal oxygen saturation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Nitrates<ul>
<li>Dilate coronary arteries (increase supply) and reduce chest pain Venodilation (decrease preload and thus demand)</li>
<li>Care must be taken if there is an inferior infarct, or if there is evident hypotension (these are contraindications)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Morphine<ul>
<li>Analgesia Causes venodilation, which decreases preload and thus oxygen requirements May mask severity of symptoms, may affect levels of antiplatelet drugs</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Sprionolactone is given if post-MI patient is high risk (e.g. HF, LV dysfunction, diabetic)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>NOTE: do NOT use GP2b3a inhibitors (tirofiban, abciximab)</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Revascularization</p>
<ul>
<li>Benefit highest when performed early (within 90 minutes of hospital arrival for patients with STEMI or new LBBB)</li>
<li>Should be considered in all patients.</li>
<li>Revascularization options include thrombolysis, PCI, or CABG<ul>
<li>Several studies have shown enhanced survival and lower rates of recurrent MI and intracranial bleeding when PCI performed by skilled personnel is chosen over thrombolysis. For patients with a delayed presentation, fibrinolysis alone may be a better option.</li>
<li>Urgent/emergent CABG is typically performed only in the setting of mechanical complications of an acute MI, cardiogenic shock, life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, or after failure of PCI. It is almost never performed in the acute setting on a stable patient.</li>
<li>Given early enough PCI/revascularisation, troponin levels (indicative of infract) may not necessarily rise, resulting in an 'aborted STEMI'</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>P2Y12 inhibitors<ul>
<li>evidence suggests that the benefit of clopidogrel or ticagrelor is additive to the effects of aspirin. Clopidogrel or ticagrelor therapy should be initiated in all patients who undergo PCI and receive a stent. Dual antiplatelet treatment with aspirin and a P2Y12 inhibitor (clopidogrel or ticagrelor) should continue for at least 30 days in patients who receive a bare metal stent, and at least 12 months in patients who receive a drug-eluting stent.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Rehabilitation<ul>
<li>Cardiac rehabilitation is a physician-supervised regimen of exercise and risk factor reduction after MI.</li>
<li>Shown to reduce symptoms and prolong survival.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="complications">Complications</h2>
<ul>
<li>Pump failure (congestive heart failure [CHF])<ul>
<li>Most common cause of in-hospital mortality</li>
<li>If mild, treat medically (ACE inhibitor, diuretic)</li>
<li>If severe, may lead to cardiogenic shock; invasive hemodynamic monitoring or support with inotropes or devices may be indicated (see Cardiogenic Shock on page 64)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Arrhythmias</p>
<p><strong><em>Ventricular arrhythmias are the most common cause of death post-MI</em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Premature ventricular contractions (PVCs)—conservative treatment (observation) indicated; no need for antiarrhythmic agents</li>
<li>Atrial fibrillation (AFib)</li>
<li>Ventricular tachycardia (VT)–sustained VT requires treatment:<ul>
<li>If patient is hemodynamically unstable, electrical cardioversion is indicated. If patient is hemodynamically stable, start antiarrhythmic therapy—see treatment of VT</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>VFib—immediate unsynchronized defibrillation and CPR are indicated</li>
<li>Accelerated idioventricular rhythm does not affect prognosis; no treatment needed in most cases</li>
<li>Paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT)</li>
<li>Sinus tachycardia<ul>
<li>May be caused by pain, anxiety, fever, pericarditis, medications, etc. Worsens ischemia (increases myocardial oxygen consumption) Treat underlying cause (analgesics for pain, acetaminophen for fever, etc.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Sinus bradycardia<ul>
<li>A common occurrence in early stages of acute MI, especially rightsided/ inferior MI.
May be a protective mechanism (reduces myocardial oxygen demand). No treatment is required other than observation. If bradycardia is severe or symptomatic (hemodynamic compromise), atropine may be helpful in increasing HR.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Asystole<ul>
<li>Very high mortality. Treatment should begin with electrical defibrillation for VFib, which is more common in cardiac arrest and may be difficult to clearly differentiate from asystole.</li>
<li>If asystole is clearly the cause of arrest, transcutaneous pacing is the appropriate treatment.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>AV block<ul>
<li>Associated with ischemia involving conduction tracts.</li>
<li>First- and second-degree (type I) blocks do not require therapy.</li>
<li>Second- (type II) and third-degree blocks: Prognosis is dire in the setting of an anterior MI—emergent placement of a temporary pacemaker is indicated (with later placement of a permanent pacemaker).</li>
<li><strong>In inferior MI, prognosis is better, and IV atropine may be used initially. If conduction is not restored, a  temporary pacemaker is appropriate</strong>. Can use positive chronotropic medications to maintain HR and blood pressures (i.e., isoproterenol or dopamine) while awaiting placement of temporary pacemaker.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Recurrent infarction (extension of existing infarction or reinfarction of a new area)</li>
<li>Both short- and long-term mortality are increased.</li>
<li>Diagnosis is often difficult.<ul>
<li>Cardiac enzymes are already elevated from the initial infarction. Troponin levels remain elevated for a week or more, so are not useful here. CK-MB returns to normal faster, and so a reelevation of CK-MB after 36 to 48 hours may be due to recurrent infarction.</li>
<li>If there is repeat ST-segment elevation on ECG within the first 24 hours after infarction, suspect recurrent infarction or LV aneurysm.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Treatment: Repeat thrombolysis or urgent cardiac catheterization and PCI. Continue standard medical therapy for MI.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Following inferior wall MI, 40% of people will also have a RV infarct (inferior wall and RV all come from right coronary artery in a right-dominant patient) - will see:
- clear lungs → pulmonary oedema occurs due to a failure of the LV 
- RV leads
- hypotension</em></p>
<p>This is a particular concern for future surgeries - Stress testing is typically warranted, however with poor functional capacity, radionuclide myocardial perfusion imaging is also acceptable </p>
<ul>
<li><em>A radionuclide myocardial perfusion imaging is indicated for the preoperative risk stratification in this patient. It may be performed with the patient exercising or by using a drug that increases myocardial perfusion (e.g., dipyridamole). Because of this patient's poor functional capacity, dipyridamole should be used. A dobutamine stress echocardiography would be an alternative test to radionuclide scan with dipyridamole as it can also be used in patients with poor functional capacity.</em></li>
<li>Mechanical complications</li>
<li>Free wall rupture<ul>
<li>A catastrophic, usually fatal event that occurs during the first 2 weeks after MI (90% within 2 weeks, most commonly 1 to 4 days after MI) 90% mortality rate</li>
<li>Usually leads to <strong>hemopericardium and cardiac tamponade</strong></li>
<li>Treatment: Hemodynamic stabilization, immediate pericardiocentesis, and surgical repair</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Rupture of interventricular septum<ul>
<li>Greater potential for successful therapy than with a free wall rupture, although this is also a critical event; emergent surgery is indicated</li>
<li>Occurs within 10 days after MI Likelihood of survival correlates with size of the defect</li>
<li>RALES present, no murmur (due to large opening, as opposed to small VSD which causes the murmur)</li>
<li>I<strong>ncreased O2 saturation between RA and RV (due to movement of oxygenated blood into RV)</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Papillary muscle rupture (same effect as valve rupture)<ul>
<li>Produces acute MR (presents with new murmur)</li>
<li>If suspected, obtain an echocardiogram immediately Emergent surgery is needed (mitral valve replacement is usually necessary), as well as afterload reduction with sodium nitroprusside or intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP)</li>
<li>RALES due to pushing of fluid by ventricles into the pulmonary vasculature</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ventricular pseudoaneurysm<ul>
<li>Incomplete free wall rupture (myocardial rupture is contained by pericardium)</li>
<li>Bedside echocardiogram may show the pseudoaneurysm</li>
<li>Surgical emergency because ventricular pseudoaneurysms tend to become a free wall rupture, risk of pericarditis and cardiac tamponade</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ventricular aneurysm<ul>
<li>Rarely rupture (in contrast to pseudoaneurysms)</li>
<li>Associated with a high incidence of ventricular tachyarrhythmias</li>
<li>Medical management may be protective</li>
<li>Surgery to remove aneurysm may be appropriate in selected patients</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Valve rupture (like papillary muscle rupture)<ul>
<li>presents with RALES, dyspnoea, tachycardia and new murmur</li>
<li>confirm with echocardiography</li>
<li>Tx: ACEi +/- surgery</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Acute pericarditis</li>
<li>The incidence has decreased sharply since the introduction of revascularization techniques.</li>
<li>Will present with an acute pleuritic and positional chest pain with diffuse ST elevation, and a concave J-point</li>
<li>Treatment consists of aspirin (which is already standard in treatment of MI).</li>
<li>NSAIDs and corticosteroids are contraindicated (may hinder myocardial scar formation).</li>
<li>Dressler syndrome (“postmyocardial infarction syndrome”)</li>
<li>Immunologically based syndrome consisting of fever, malaise, pericarditis, leukocytosis, and pleuritis, occurring weeks to months after an MI</li>
<li>Aspirin is the most effective therapy. Ibuprofen is a second option.</li>
<li>Cardiac Tamponade</li>
<li>Sudden loss of pulse (pulseless electrical activity)</li>
<li>Beck's triad: Hypotension, Muffled heart sounds, Raised JVP</li>
<li>Left bundle branch block</li>
<li><em>A new-onset left bundle branch block (LBBB) on ECG in association with typical symptoms of acute myocardial infarction is diagnostic of an ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), as the presence of an LBBB often masks ST elevations. If a myocardial infarction involves &gt; 40% of the myocardium it often leads to cardiogenic shock, as seen in this patient. Acute myocardial infarction is a common postsurgical complication, particularly in those with a history of atherosclerotic disease.</em></li>
