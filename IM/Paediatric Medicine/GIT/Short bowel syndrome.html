<p>SHORT BOWEL SYNDROME
» General Considerations
Short bowel syndrome (SBS) is defined as a condition
resulting from reduced intestinal absorptive surface that
leads to alteration in intestinal function that compromises
normal growth, fluid/electrolyte balance, or hydration
status. The vast majority of pediatric patients with SBS
have undergone neonatal surgical resection of intestine.
The most common etiologies in children are necrotizing
enterocolitis (45%); intestinal atresias (23%); gastroschisis

GASTROINTESTINAL TRACT 639
(15%); volvulus (15%); and, less commonly, congenital
short bowel, long-segment Hirschsprung disease, and
ischemic bowel. In many instances, infants with SBS
require PN in order to provide adequate caloric, fluid, and
electrolyte delivery in the setting of insufficient intestinal
absorptive function. The requirement of supplemental
PN for more than 2–3 months in the setting of SBS or
any other underlying disorder qualifies the diagnosis of
intestinal failure (IF).
The goal in management of the patient with SBS is to
promote growth and adaptation of the intestine such that
adequate nutrition can be delivered and absorbed enterally.
Many factors, including patient’s gestational age, postsurgical anatomy (including residual small bowel length and
presence of ileocecal valve and/or colon), presence of small
bowel bacterial overgrowth, and underlying surgical disease,
influence the process and likelihood of bowel adaptation
and achievement of enteral autonomy. No specific anatomic bowel length measurements offer 100% certainty in
predicting clinical outcomes in SBS.
» Symptoms &amp; Signs
Typical symptoms for the patient with SBS are related to
their underlying malabsorptive state, including diarrhea,
dehydration, electrolyte or micronutrient deficiency states,
and growth failure. Patients with SBS are also at risk for
small bowel obstruction, bowel dilation and dysmotility
(with secondary small bowel bacterial overgrowth), hepatobiliary disorders including cholelithiasis, nephrolithiasis
due to calcium oxalate stones, oral feeding challenges, and
GI mucosal inflammatory problems including noninfectious
colitis and anastomotic ulcerations. For patients with IF,
complications related to underlying PN therapy are common and can be life threatening. PN-associated liver disease
(PNALD) is a progressive cholestatic liver injury that occurs
in pediatric patients on PN and may progress to end-stage
liver disease in 10% of affected patients. Recurrent catheterrelated bloodstream infections are relatively common in
pediatric patients with SBS and IF. Other complicationrelated central venous catheters including occlusions may
require intervention.
» Treatment &amp; Prognosis
Goal in management of SBS is to promote growth and
adaptation while minimizing and/or treating complications of the underlying intestinal disorder or PN therapy.
Intestinal rehabilitation for the child with SBS and IF
refers to the multidisciplinary team approach to individual
patient care, involving gastroenterology, nutrition, and
surgery, and has been shown to improve outcomes. Enteral
nutrition should be catered to favor absorption, commonly
requiring continuous delivery of an elemental formula
through a gastrostomy tube. Commonly prescribed pharmacologic adjuncts include acid suppressive therapy, antimotility and antidiarrheal agents, and antibiotics for the
treatment of small bowel bacterial overgrowth. Emerging
therapies targeted to promote bowel adaptation include
glucagon-like peptide 2 analogues, which show promise in
potentially increasing absorption and bowel adaptation in
ongoing trials.
Management for the patient with SBS and IF should
include strategies to manage or prevent complications related
to PN therapy, including infection and liver disease. Antimicrobial lock solutions distilled into central venous catheters
using either ethanol or antibiotics may have a role in reducing infection rates. Compelling evidence over the past several
years suggests that modification of parenteral lipid solution,
either through reduction in dose of soy-based intralipid or
replacement with a third-generation lipid solution (Omegaven or SMOF lipid), improves outcomes associated with
PNALD in pediatric patients.
Autologous bowel reconstructive surgery (bowel lengthening) should be considered in a patient who is failing to
advance enterally and has anatomy amendable to surgical
intervention, typically with regards to adequate bowel dilation. Both the serial transverse enteroplasty (STEP) procedure and longitudinal intestinal lengthening and tailoring
(Bianchi) procedure have been successful in allowing weaning from TPN in up to 50% of patients in reported series. In
recent years, the STEP procedure has gained favor as being
potentially less technically demanding and repeatable, if the
bowel dilates sufficiently after the initial procedure.
When medical, nutritional, and surgical managements
fail, intestinal transplantation may be considered for a child
with refractory and life-threatening complications of IF.
Current outcome data after pediatric intestinal transplantation suggest 1- and 3-year survival rates of 83% and 60%,
respectively.</p></div>
