<h1 id="intussusception">Intussusception</h1>
<p>In intussusception, the distal ileum (the intussusceptum) telescopes into adjoining distal bowel (the intussuscipiens), resulting in intestinal obstruction. It can occur at any age but is most likely in the infant between 3 and 18 months who suddenly develops screaming attacks of pain with vomiting. During each episode of pain the infant becomes pale and may draw up the legs.</p>
<p>The spasms of pain tend to last for 2–3 minutes and occur at intervals of about 10–20 minutes, although after a while the pain becomes more persistent. Vomiting is an early symptom. The passage of a few loose stools early on represents evacuation of the bowel distal to the obstruction. The small volume and limited duration of loose stools in intussusception helps differentiate it from acute gastroenteritis. Congestion of the intussusceptum may lead to the passage of blood-stained or ‘redcurrant jelly’ stools. Many infants with intussusception present with little more than pallor, lethargy and vomiting, and may have little evidence of abdominal pain. Should these symptoms be ignored, the infant may progress to develop signs of septicaemia or shock.</p>
<p>The infant with intussusception looks pale, lethargic, anxious and unwell. A vague mass may be felt in the right or left upper quadrants of the abdomen but, once abdominal distension has developed, the mass becomes obscure and difficult to palpate. The apex of the intussusceptum may be palpable on rectal examination in a few, and the examining glove may be blood-stained. A plain X-ray of the abdomen will often be normal but may show an unusual bowel gas distribution or features of bowel obstruction. Ultrasound examination may be helpful in making the diagnosis. Where intussusception is suspected clinically or confirmed on ultrasonography, a gas or barium enema must be performed (unless the child has peritonitis). The enema will demonstrate the position of the apex of the intussusception .</p>

<h3 id="general-features">General features</h3>
<ul>
<li>Age: 6-9Mo; uncommon &lt;3mo or &gt;6y</li>
<li>Aetiology: 75% idiopathic, 20% post-viral</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="pathogenesis">Pathogenesis</h3>
<ul>
<li>Invagination of proximal small bowel into distal segment (peristalsis) → trapping → ischaemia → sloughing of mucosa → mucus and bleeding (red currant jelly)<ul>
<li>10% associated with lead point (= a piece of intestinal tissue which protrudes into the bowel lumen)</li>
<li>?Rotavirus, ?Infection as other causative agents</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>2-8% pathological lead point (intestinal tissue which protrudes into the bowel lumen) e.g. Meckel’s diverticulum, lymphoma, duplication cyst<ul>
<li>Peutz-Jeghers syndrome – lip pigmentation - polyps</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Typically occurs in the ileo-caelcal valve (75-95%) due to abundance of lymphoid tissue (lead points)<ul>
<li>ileoileocolic is second most common, whereas ileoileal, colocolic and gastric are uncommon</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Almost all intussusceptions occur with the intussusceptum having been located proximally to the intussuscipiens - due to peristaltic action of intestine pulling proximal segment INTO distal segment</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="clinical-features">Clinical features</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Classical triad in 15%:</strong> otherwise <strong>inconsolable, pallor, lethargy after pain subsides</strong><ul>
<li>crampy (intermittent, colicky) abdominal pain – drawing legs up</li>
<li>vomiting (<strong>initially non bile stained</strong>), and</li>
<li><strong>bloody stools (red currant jelly late sign) due to compression of bowel</strong></li>
<li>may feel abdominal mass in epigastrium or RUQ</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Ileocolic in 95%</strong> (ileum → caecum) - <strong>abundance of lymphoid tissue related to the terminal ileum, most are idiopathic</strong><ul>
<li>Ileoileum – small bowel into small bowel – <strong>does not require surgical intervention unless &gt;2cm and evidence of SBO</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="examination">Examination</h3>
<ul>
<li>Exam<ul>
<li>early little</li>
<li>abdo mass may be tender due to ischaemia</li>
<li>DRE may reveal PR bleeding (not in nappy or noted by mum)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="investigations">Investigations</h3>
<ul>
<li>AXR - mass, lack of gas, fluid levels=obstruction, ?free intraperitoneal gas – 50% yield</li>
<li>GS imaging: Abdo US – rule out pyelonephritis<ul>
<li><strong>Target sign (3cm)/doughnut sign</strong>: <strong>concentric alternating echogenic (mucosa/muscularis) and hypoechogenic (submucosa) bands</strong>.</li>
<li>Pseudokidney sign: longitudinal US of the intussuscepted segment of bowel. The fat containing mesentery → intussusception, which contains vessels, resembles the renal hilum. The renal parenchyma is formed by the oedematous bowel</li>
<li><strong>crescent in a doughnut sign</strong>: transverse US appearance of intestinal intussusception. The crescent is formed by mesentery dragged into the intussusception. It is only on one side of the bowel → echogenic crescent</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="management">Management</h3>
<p>(not usually immediately life-threatening)</p>
<ol>
<li>Resuscitation (bolus, maintenance, replacement)</li>
<li>Pain relief</li>
<li><strong>no role for ABx if no signs of ischemia, peritonitis, infection – risk of gram negative sepsis</strong></li>
<li>Mx:<ul>
<li>Non-operative<ul>
<li><strong>Air enema reduction 85% successful</strong>. Long history and presence of a lead point less successful. Confirmed if <strong>reflux of air into small bowel</strong>.<ul>
<li>foley catheter placed into bottom and buttocks strapped, air pressure is delivered to 80mmHg - air enters, and reduces the colon until it reaches the distal small bowel; until reflux of air into small bowel, the procedure is NOT successful. Failure requires surgery.<ul>
<li>Recurrence of 5% within 24h within 30% of patients</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Give 3 min – if has not moved → theatre</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>CI if perforation – 1% risk</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Surgery: When enema fails - abdomen is opened and part telescoped in is <strong>squeezed out</strong> (rather than pulled out – risk of tearing the bowel) manually – otherwise resected<ul>
<li>Perforation</li>
<li>Sick child</li>
<li>Failed reduction</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Intussusception can be reduced non-operatively by gas enema or by hydrostatic reduction under ultrasonographic control: these techniques are successful in 80–90% of patients. If gas enema facilities are not available, a barium enema under continuous fluoroscopic control is a less effective but satisfactory alternative. Peritonitis and septicaemia, which suggest the presence of dead bowel, are the only contraindications to attempted enema reduction. A dehydrated child should have intravenous fluid resuscitation and be wrapped in warm blankets before commencing an enema reduction. The success of enema reduction is recognized when there is sudden or rapid flow of gas or barium into the ileum. If partial reduction is achieved, and the child remains in good clinical condition, a further enema should be attempted after several hours (so called ‘delayed repeat enema’), and in about half of these patients it will be successful. Recurrence of intussusception occurs in about 9% of children after enema reduction, usually within days. Surgery is reserved for:</p>
<ul>
<li>those in whom enema reduction has failed</li>
<li>those who have clinical evidence of necrotic bowel, such as peritonitis and septicaemia</li>
<li>those in whom there is evidence of pathological lesions at the lead point.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="prognosis">Prognosis</h3>
<ul>
<li>Recurrence 10% - about <strong>5% within 24 hours</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Clinical example</strong></p>
<p>Tim, a previously well 22-month-old infant, suddenly became unwell with onset of vomiting and a temperature of 38.5 °C. Within 12 hours he started passing frequent, loose motions. Associated with this he appeared to have bouts of abdominal pain. On the second day the vomiting stopped but the diarrhoea persisted at a rate of more than eight stools per day. On presentation to the emergency department, Tim's weight was 13.6 kg, compared with 14.5 kg 3 weeks previously. He was clinically assessed to be 5–8% dehydrated and was treated with an oral rehydration solution via a nasogastric tube. A provisional diagnosis of acute gastroenteritis was made. His temperature gradually settled over 24 hours and oral feeds were introduced once rehydration was complete. His stools returned to their normal pattern after 5 days. Rapid stool testing for rotavirus antigen was positive.</p></div>
