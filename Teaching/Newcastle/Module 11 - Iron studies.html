<h1 id="module-11-iron-studies">Module 11 - Iron studies</h1>
<h2 id="case-1">Case 1</h2>
<p>•Angular stomatitis- causes include oral candidiasis, bacterial infection, nutritional deficiencies (iron and vitamin B)</p>
<p>•Atrophic glossitis- flattening of the papillae of the tongue- causes include- micronutrient deficiency- iron, vitamin B</p>
<hr/>
<p>•How would you interpret these results?</p>
<p>•Bao has microcytic hypochromic anaemia with a low red cell count, and a reticulocyte percentage that, although raised, is lower than expected for the degree of anaemia. There is also a thrombocytosis that may be reactive.</p>
<p>•What are the major causes of anaemia associated with these findings?</p>
<p>•Causes of microcytic hypochromic anaemia include: </p>
<p>•Iron deficiency</p>
<p>•Disorders of globin synthesis such as thalassaemia or another haemoglobinopathy</p>
<p>•Disorders of porphyrin or haem synthesis (sideroblastic anaemia which may be congenital or associated with lead poisoning)</p>
<p>•Anaemia of chronic disease may cause a microcytic hypochromic appearance</p>
<p>•Which of these causes is most likely given the FBE results and why?</p>
<p>•A microcytic hypochromic anaemia is most often due to iron deficiency in a patient such as Bao. His microcytosis is mild and is of an appropriate severity given the degree of anaemia. The presence of a more severe microcytosis with a lesser degree of anaemia may lead one to suspect thalassaemia.  The thromboycytosis is a common finding in patients with iron deficiency and is reactive in nature.</p>
<p>•What further testing is indicated?</p>
<p>•Iron studies are indicated to assess for iron deficiency. The presence of thalassaemia trait cannot be ruled out without further testing or without assessing response to iron therapy if iron studies indicate an iron deficiency.</p>
<hr/>
<p>•Bao had iron studies, liver function tests and CRP performed. His LFTs and CRP were normal. Interpret the results of his iron studies.</p>
<hr/>
<p>•What are the most common causes of iron deficiency anaemia?</p>
<p>•Gastrointestinal bleeding is the most common cause in Bao’s age group. The most common sites are: upper GIT- oesophageal ulceration, malignancy, haemorrhoids, colorectal neoplasia, diverticular disease, angiodysplasia, Meckel diverticulum, coeliac disease.</p>
<p>•History should focus on- GI blood loss or melaena, weight loss, alcohol use, reflux symptoms, family history of GI cancer.</p>
<p>•What further investigations are required for Bao?</p>
<p>•Regardless of clinical findings that point to a specific cause for iron loss, a patient requires upper and lower GP endoscopies to exclude GI causes for blood loss, particularly malignancy. Referral to a gastroenterologist for these procedures is indicated.</p>
<hr/>
<h2 id="case-2">Case 2</h2>
<p>•The patient has a marked macrocytic anaemia with reticulocytopenia, thrombocytopaenia and mild leucopaenia. Neutrophil hypersegmentation  is associated with a number of aetiologies, the most common being megaloblastic anaemia.</p>
<p>•Clinically she has developed a peripheral neuropathy (loss of distal proprioception and vibration sense loss, loss of sense of light touch).</p>
<hr/>
<p>•What are the causes of this blood picture?</p>
<p>•Macrocytic anaemia is most commonly associated with folate or B12 deficiency (megaloblastic anaemia). Myelodysplasia is a cause of macrocytic anaemia and pancytopaenia seen in the older population.  Macrocytic anaemia may also be seen in patients with excessive alcohol intake, liver disease or hypothyroidism. It is also a common finding in patients taking antimetabolite meds such as methotrexate, certain antibiotics and antiretrovirals.</p>
<p>•Neutrophil hypersegmentation accompanies megaloblastic anaemia and therefore may occur with folate or B12 deficiency or the drugs above.</p>
<p>•Macrocytosis is also a feature of the myelodysplastic syndromes. This may also be accompanied by neutropaenia or thrombocytopaenia.</p>
<p>•Marked macrocytosis (&gt;130fL) as seen in Helen’s case usually indicates B12 or folate deficiency</p>
<p>•This results from: inadequate intake, poor absorption, or excessive utilisation (particularly for folate)</p>
<p>•Animal products contain B12, whereas green vegetables contain folate</p>
<p>•B12 requires an adequate acid environment in the stomach as well as secretion of intrinsic factor and a function ileum for successful absorption. Folate is absorbed in the jejumum. Before treating folate deficiency it is important to exclude concomitant B12 deficiency</p>
<hr/>
<p>•What further tests are required?</p>
<p>•B12 and folate levels</p>
<p>•B12 ref ranges vary between labs, and with repeat samples therefore careful interpretation required</p>
<p>•Serum folate a measure of short term folate balance, Red cell folate may better reflect long term stores, however not as reproducible as serum folate.</p>
<hr/>
<p>•This patient has multiple potential causes for having a B12 deficiency. She may have gastritis from her excessive ETOH intake (which may be more than she is stating). She has been on a Proton Pump inhibitor for a long time, which can block B12 absorption. Her diet may be inadequate if she following an overly restrictive diet (such as vegan).</p>
<p>•Students should also consider pernicious anaemia but it is beyond the scope of this tutorial to go into the detail of pernicious anaemia. It is appropriate to check for intrinsic factor antibody if her B12 level is low as this is highly specific (ie virtually diagnostic) of pernicious anaemia, but has low sensitivity.   Equivocal cases should be discussed with a gastroenterologist.</p>
<p>•Folate deficiency may be caused by poor dietary intake and alcoholism, coeliac disease or inflammatory bowel disease or the other causes previously mentioned  on slide 19.</p>
<hr/>
<h2 id="case-3">Case 3</h2>
<p>What differential diagnosis should you consider at this stage?</p>
<p>Infection- Hep B or C, drugs, alcohol, autoimmune chronic active hepatitis, haemochromatosis</p>
<p>Symptoms and family history suggest haemochromatosis which can cause lethargy and arthralgia</p>
<p>The disorder can cause iron deposition in the liver (cirrhosis), skin (hyperpigmentation), pituitary (hypogonadism), pancreas (diabetes), joints (arthropathy), heart (cardiomyopathy)</p>
<p>What further investigations should you do?</p>
<p>Iron studies, fasting blood glucose, Hepatitis virus serology, abdo USS, coagulation studies</p>
<hr/>
<p>•What is your diagnosis?</p>
<p>•Hereditary haemochromatosis</p>
<p>•What further investigations should be done?</p>
<p>•Other family members should be screened</p>
<p>•Haemochromatosis gene testing: C282Y and H63D</p>
<p>•Liver biopsy- because of abnormal LFTs, ferritin &gt;1000 and hepatomegaly, OR MRI to evaluate liver status</p>
<p>•Management may include referral to a gastroenterologist, will need weekly venesection until serum iron levels return to normal (may take 2-3 years). Avoid alcohol.</p>
<p>•His fasting blood glucose should be monitored as it is impaired.</p>
