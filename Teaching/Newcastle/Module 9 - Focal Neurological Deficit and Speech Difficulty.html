<h2 id="presentation">Presentation</h2>
<p>Maria is a 76 year old lady of Italian descent. She has been in Australia for 40 years and speaks English well. She previously worked as a teacher’s aide in the local primary school.</p>
<p>Maria lives with her son Joe and his wife in Wyoming and is usually independent with all her activities of daily living although Joe helps out with some more complicated financial transactions and has done so since his Dad passed away ten years ago.</p>
<p>Maria’s  family bring her to the emergency department at Gosford Hospital as they were concerned to find that whilst having her morning cup of tea (around 8am) she appeared to develop some mild right facial weakness and they were having difficulty understanding what she was trying to say. She picked up her mug and promptly dropped it.</p>
<p>Maria’s  family bring her to the emergency department at Gosford Hospital as they were concerned to find that whilst having her morning cup of tea (around 8am) she appeared to develop some mild right facial weakness and they were having difficulty understanding what she was trying to say. She picked up her mug and promptly dropped it.</p>
<p>She was able to walk to the car so they brought her to the hospital ED themselves as they were only 5 minutes drive away.
 </p>
<hr/>
<h2 id="questions-part-1">Questions (Part 1):</h2>
<ol>
<li>Was it a smart idea to bring Maria into hospital by family car?</li>
<li>What are the advantages of calling an ambulance?<ul>
<li>Manage deterioration</li>
<li>Appropriate hospital</li>
<li>BAT CALL - to call ahead so no delay on arrival</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How should she be triaged on arrival, what are the critical components of initial assessment?<ul>
<li>ABCDE</li>
<li>Level of consciousness</li>
<li>Airway security</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<hr/>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>When you ask they state that Maria seemed perfectly fine when she went to bed the night before and on first waking this morning. </p>
<ul>
<li>Importance of being OK first thing this am?<ul>
<li>We are now able to establish how long Maria has been off for</li>
<li>This is important in determining the type of treatment she is eligible for</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>She was not complaining of headache or feeling otherwise unwell.  She has not had these type of symptoms previously and does not suffer from migraine.</p>
<ul>
<li>What are the primary differentials? <ul>
<li>Stroke/TIA, Migraine, epilepsy, hypoglycaemia</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Anything else in history which may be of importance?<ul>
<li>Rule out stroke mimics - migraine, epilepsy, hypoglycaemia<ul>
<li>Has she had similar symptoms in the past?</li>
<li>Diabetes and blood sugars?</li>
<li>Complains of headache (migraine)</li>
<li>Known AF or risk factors for vascular disease?</li>
<li>On anticoagulants (i.e. risk of haemorrhage)?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>However RECOGNISE that time is of the essence - a stroke call should be done by this point</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr/>
<h2 id="past-medical-history">Past medical history</h2>
<p>Maria suffers from Type 2 diabetes mellitus
She has well controlled hypertension and is overweight (BMI 28)
She had a left total knee replacement two years ago without perioperative complications and is now independently mobile without aids
She has not had any need for hospitalisation since the time of the knee replacement</p>
<hr/>
<h2 id="medications">Medications</h2>
<p>Metformin 500mg bd,
Amlodipine 5mg daily,
Paracetamol 1g qid prn,</p>
<ul>
<li>What classes of medications are the first two listed?<ul>
<li>Metformin is a biguanide - diabetic medication</li>
<li>Amlodipine is a calcium channel blocker (dihydropyridine)<ul>
<li>What is an example of a non-dihydropyridine (Verapamil, diltiazem)</li>
<li>What is the difference in cardiovascular effect between DHP and non-DHP? (non-DHPs have greater negative inotropic effect)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr/>
<h2 id="examination">Examination</h2>
<p>You need to examine Maria’s speech to see what it is the family are concerned about.</p>
<ul>
<li>What types of speech disturbance will you be looking for? What is the difference between dysphasia, dysarthria and dysphonia?<ul>
<li>Dysphasia<ul>
<li>Expressive aphasia</li>
<li>Receptive aphasia</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Dysarthria</li>
<li>Dysphonia</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Describe a system for examination of speech<ul>
<li>In the setting of possible stroke the NIH stroke scale would be performed and this includes screening tests for dysphasia (obeys commands-open close eyes/hands, describe the picture below and name the objects in the other picture) and dysarthria (read the words on the sheet). </li>
<li>The students can be asked to think about the limitations here (how good is her English? Can she read? What would they do of the answer to either is no?)<ul>
<li>Ask a family member to help</li>
<li>Involve a translator</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Screening = Ask something hard and if the patient can do it then they’re <em>probably</em> OK<ul>
<li>Reception: Point to the ceiling after you point to the floor</li>
<li>Repetition: Repeat after me: “No ifs ands or buts”, “hippopotamus”</li>
<li>Language function is often clear after taking a history, but if not</li>
<li>Naming: Collar, sleeve, cuff; knuckles</li>
<li>Fluent speech: History or a task such as describing a picture, reading a paragraph</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What type of lesion (site central/peripheral) would be associated each type of speech disturbance?<ul>
<li>The areas associated with language and which are affected in dysphasia are the posterior temporal lobe (Wernicke’s, language comprehension), posterior inferior frontal lobe (Broca’s area, production of meaningful language)</li>
<li>Dysarthria can result from both UMN and LMN lesions anywhere from motor cortex, cranial nerves, cerebellum or muscles involved in speech,</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Actually by the time you finish getting the brief description from the family (about 5 minutes) and start to examine Maria you find her speech has returned to normal.
The family are a little surprised but relieved.
You examine the rest of her neurological system and find that there are no signs of facial or limb weakness and she even gets up out of the bed and walks quite normally</p>
<ul>
<li>What else do you need to examine?<ul>
<li>Other focal neurological signs including weakness including motor drift, hemi-sensory loss, neglect, co-ordination, visual fields. Make sure the students are able to name all of these as part of their evaluation of the patient</li>
<li>https://www.stroke.nih.gov/documents/NIH_Stroke_Scale_508C.pdf
 The remainder of the neurological examination including the cranial nerves is normal. What other neurological functions have you examined?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The remainder of the neurological examination including the cranial nerves is normal.
BP is 145/90 without a postural drop
Her heart rate is 66 bpm and regular 
There are no cardiac murmurs or <a href="../../Signs%20Symptoms%20and%20Tests/Cardiovascular/Carotid%20Bruit.html">Carotid Bruit</a> and she is afebrile
There are no abnormalities on examination of the abdomen
 
- What is the most likely working diagnosis at this point?
    - TIA
- Are there any important differentials we need to exclude?
    - Migraine, Seizure, Hypoglycaemia, Stroke
    - Syncope/severe hypotension (but no dizziness)
- What investigations would you like to perform?
    - Immediate: CTB and CT Arch to CoW - should be done for the stroke workup
        - ECG done for exclusion of AF or silent ischemia
    - Bloods: FBC, EUC, CMP (electrolyte, anemia, infection)
        - EUC needed (or a VBG can be done) to find SCr - needed if you order a CT Arch to CoW
        - BSL (also found on VBG) to exclude hypoglycaemia</p>
<hr/>
<h2 id="investigations">Investigations</h2>
<p>ECG normal,
BSL normal,
FBC EUC CMP LFT all normal,
CTB: Multitrauma cases taking up scanners</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>What will we do now?
    1) send her home to see her GP in a couple of days
    2) ask her to come to the next neurology clinic
    3) admit her to the general ward overnight
    4) admit her to the stroke unit for observation and further investigations</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is her estimated risk of stroke in the next 2 days</p>
<ul>
<li>ABCD2 score -  Her age &gt;60, BP&gt;140, unilateral weakness at the time of the episode and diabetes all increase the risk. The duration of symptoms is the other factor and that is unclear here.</li>
<li>(The use of this score to define a group of lower risk patients who can have their investigations less urgently is now discouraged however we do know that more of these risk factors correlates to a higher risk of recurrent episodes as does the presence of recurrent episodes on history)   Her ABCD2 score is at least 5 which puts her risk of stroke in the next 2 days between 4.1 and 8.1%</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>- Maria is seen by the stroke team in ED, given some chewable aspirin immediately and transferred to the stroke unit - hand over to the stroke team
    - Students should use an ISBAR format to summarise their handover information.
    - Identify: Hi I am ……and I have been looking after Maria this morning as the JMO in ED
    - Situation: Maria has presented with acute onset of a speech deficit with facial and possible arm weakness noted by her family at 8 am this morning. This had fully resolved by the time she was assessed here in ED.
    - Background: Maria is normally very independent functionally but she is diabetic and being treated for hypertension
    - Assessment : Neuro exam, BP, BSL, ECG. She is waiting for a scan
    - Recommendation: The CT scanner is currently not free. She needs to have her imaging as soon as the scanner is available and should be admitted to the stroke unit if you are in agreement.</p>
<hr/>
<h2 id="management">Management</h2>
<p>Maria is seen by the stroke team in ED, given some chewable aspirin immediately and transferred to the stroke unit</p>
<ul>
<li>What happens in the stroke unit?<ul>
<li>She is also started on a statin and placed on regular BP and continuous cardiac monitoring</li>
<li>She is booked for a CT angiogram (Arch to Circle of Willis), echocardiograph</li>
<li>Holter monitor booked</li>
<li>Bloods for tomorrow ordered, including FBC, EUC, CMP, LFT, HbA1c, fasting lipids
Around 30 mins later (9am) the RN notes that her rhythm appears abnormal on the telemetry and organises a repeat ECG
Her blood pressure and other observations have remained normal throughout</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="" src="figs/Pasted%20image%2020220714232457.png"/></p>
<ul>
<li>Interpret and report on this ECG<ul>
<li>Rate: irregularly irregular, 72 BPM</li>
<li>Rhythm: Irregularly irregular with no obvious p-waves</li>
<li>Axis: Left-deviated axis</li>
<li>P-wave absent</li>
<li>PR interval NAD</li>

<hr/>
<h2 id="progress">Progress</h2>
<p>Maria is still waiting for further cerebral imaging when the RN does her regular observations at 9.20am and notes that Maria has developed a dense right sided hemiplegia and dysphasia
The stroke registrar is called and the radiology department is asked to move the CT angiogram to the urgent queue. Maria’s family are called to come back from the coffee shop downstairs.</p>
<ul>
<li>What might be happening now?<ul>
<li>Re-infarct in same territory, likely ischemic in origin (Cardioembolic)<ul>
<li>Likely middle cerebral artery based on signs (Left)</li>
<li>Still needs CT-brain non-con but now more urgent</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>mechanisms of ischemic stroke: large vessel disease, cardioembolic, small vessel, venous infarction, vasculopathies</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Opacification of left MCA</li>
</ul>
<p>The CT excludes haemorrhage and the angiogram shows clot in the M1 segment of the left middle cerebral artery
Intravenous thrombolysis is administered at 9.50am within 3 hours of the onset of symptoms</p>

<h2 id="further-questions">Further questions</h2>
<ul>
<li>Explain the mechanism of action of thrombolytic therapy and potential adverse reactions<ul>
<li>rtPA, streptokinin are both fibrinolytics</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What are the major contraindications and how long after the onset of symptoms is therapy indicated in acute stroke?<ul>
<li>ABSOLUTE contraindications<ul>
<li>Brain bleed: Recent haemorrhage stroke, head trauma, metastases/tumours</li>
<li>Body bleed: ?aortic dissection, recent surgery in last 3 months</li>
<li><a href="../../BCS/Pharmacology/Classes/Fibrinolytics.html">Fibrinolytics</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In practice, relative contraindication is also SBP &lt; 180mmHg<ul>
<li>Needs to be brought down before giving it</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Indication for thrombolysis is that it must be given within 4.5 hours of symptom onset
- Is there any other treatment that could be used in this patient?</li>
<li>ECR is performed for proximal/larger lesions (in M1 and M2 vessels typically) - time to treatment must be &lt;24h for improved outcomes</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>She is discussed with the interventional team at Royal North Shore and is accepted for transfer for consideration of endovascular clot retrieval
Whilst in transit she has complete resolution of her symptoms and signs and does not undergo further treatment
The echocardiogram is performed at RNSH to complete her diagnostic work-up and shows some mild atrial dilatation only.
There are no further events or complications.</p>
<ul>
<li>What ongoing management needs to be considered prior to discharge?<ul>
<li>Speech path, PT, OT clearance</li>
<li>Will patient be safe to go home? SW and ACAT? </li>
