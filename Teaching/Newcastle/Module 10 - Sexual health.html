<hr/>
<h2 id="case-1-es">Case 1: ES</h2>
<p>Emily is a 20 year old University student in Armidale who presents to the University Health Service.
She has a new partner and they have decided to undergo a sexual health check before taking their relationship any further.  She is requesting ‘test me for everything’</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the first step in conducting a sexual health check?<ul>
<li>Take a sexual history to determine risk</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr/>
<h2 id="sexual-history">Sexual History</h2>
<p>Questions to Ask:</p>
<ul>
<li>I’d like to ask you some questions about sex so we can decide what tests to do. Is that ok?<ul>
<li>When was the last time you had sex? 3 weeks ago</li>
<li>Who have you been having sex with? My ex</li>
<li>Have you had sex with anyone else?<ul>
<li>One other boyfriend, couple of hook ups in between</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How did you have sex (Vaginal sex/oral sex/anal sex) ?<ul>
<li>Vaginal and oral </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Did you use a condom?  <ul>
<li>Couple of times no, one of the one night stands no</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In the last 3 months, how many sexual partners have you had? Just my ex</li>
<li>Have you ever been diagnosed with (or thought you had) an STI? No way</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I’d like to ask you about some other activities that could increase someone’s risk of some sexually transmitted infections and blood-borne viruses, is that ok? </p>
<ul>
<li>Have any of your male partners ever had sex with men? <ul>
<li>Not that they told me!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Have you had sex with other women? Nope</li>
<li>Are you pregnant? No way! Implanon 3 months ago</li>
<li>Have you ever been paid to have sex? No</li>
<li>Have you ever had any tattoos? If yes, was that here or overseas?<ul>
<li>Small butterfly on my shoulder, in Armidale</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Have you ever injected drugs? No</li>
</ul>
<hr/>
<ul>
<li>What else should be done for Emily?<ul>
<li>Has she had a cervical screening test, if so when?</li>
<li>She has had HPV vaccination in school but has never had CST</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Does she need a pelvic examination?<ul>
<li>As she has had HPV vaccination, is under 25 and asymptomatic she does not need a  pelvis examination at this time</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What STI(s) should she be screened for?<ul>
<li>Chlamydia screening is recommended for all sexually active people &lt;30 years</li>
<li>Consider Hepatitis B, HIV &amp; Syphilis in low risk populations (recommend test if not   low risk)</li>
<li>Consider Gonorrhoea screening in at risk groups, may be asymptomatic</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What tests are required to screen for these STI?  How do you instruct Emily in collecting the sample?<ul>
<li>In the absence of a pelvic examination a self collected vaginal swab has better   sensitivity than a first pass urine.  NAAT (Nuclear acid amplication test) is performed for both Chlamydia and Gonorrhoea</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr/>
<h2 id="self-testing">Self testing</h2>
<ul>
<li>Self testing for NAAT is acceptable, especially when patient is uncomfortable with clinician collection or limited consultation times</li>
<li>PCR is very sensitive</li>
<li>Only appropriate flr <strong>asymptomatic patients</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="procedure">Procedure</h3>

<li>Show swab to patient</li>
<li>Label tubes with details to avoid mishandling</li>
<li>Moisten tip of swab with saline or sterile water</li>
<li>Put all equipment in specimen bag and hand to patient</li>
<li>Review collection process with patient, remind to put swab inside tube, seal tube and put sealed tube inside specimen bag</li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li>
<p>How would you treat Casey?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You tell Casey that she most likely has a viral infection and it should get better in a couple of days.</p>
</li>
<li>You write her a medical certificate, recommend paracetamol, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medication, fluids and rest and ask her to return in 3 days if she is no better.</li>
<li>Casey returns a week later with the same symptoms.  She looks tired and her voice is hoarse but she continues to be afebrile.</li>
<li>Her oropharynx is unchanged</li>
<li>As she has had a sore throat for 10 days you are concerned that she may have a streptococcal throat infection<ul>
<li>You take a swab of Casey’s tonsils to confirm your suspicions</li>
<li>You prescribe phenoxypenicillin and once again ask her to return if she does not improve</li>

<li>Casey now discloses to you that although she does work in a call centre she also works as a sex worker part time.  She is adamant that she always practices safe sex with a condom.</li>
<li>
<p>Does this change the differential diagnoses?</p>

<li>You are suspicious that her sore throat could be secondary to Neisseria gonorrhoea and decide to take a swab.<ul>
<li>You decide to commence treatment for N gonorrhoea</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li>
<p>You recall that there are difficulties with emerging resistance of Gonorrhoea and treat Casey with 500mg ceftriaxone IM and 1g azithromycin PO</p>
<ul>
<li>You also recommend to Casey that she have testing for other STI. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
